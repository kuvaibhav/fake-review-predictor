The decor is very homey and displays photos and postcards I'm assuming the owners received from their customers. This place is cash only, but they do have an ATM next to the bathroom. For dinner, Pates Et Traditions offers various crepes, salads, and pastas. Definitely go for the crepes as, in my opinion, they do much better than the other offerings. Coming with a group of friends, I was able to try a crepe and sample two kinds of pasta. La Popeye - This is the buckwheat crepe with spinach, cream, egg, garlic, and swiss. This has to be one of the best crepes I have ever had (and also I can't remember the other crepes too well because this one was so good). I am not a big fan of swiss and I thought it would be too creamy with the swiss and cream, but the spinach was perfect. The texture of the buckwheat crepe was perfect as well. Crispy, not to thick, but stands up to the filling well. Only less than perfect thing was the egg, which I feel they overcooked. I like my egg yolk nice and runny, but this one was quite cooked through. Duck Fettuccinis - This dish was not as delicious as the crepe I ordered and was the most expensive pasta on the menu. The cream sauce was really bland and fettuccine slightly less than al dente. The duck had no duck flavor. In my opinion, duck should not be cut into such small medallions. Veggie Penne - I only had a bite, but this was delicious. The tomato sauce was very fresh and the penne had a good texture. I did not try this, but my friend ordered an Amaretto shake and was sorely disappointed. Instead of ice cream, it was a mix of ice, milk, and amaretto, which overall did not make for a satisfying shake. But if you come to Pates Et Traditions, forget about the salads or the shakes. Go for the crepes."

We were told that there was no space at the bar (there were 3 stools open) and that we couldn't sit down because of their reservations(it was 5pm and only about 4 people sitting and eating). It was then that we realized it was because we were people of color. My is friend is Black and I'm Hispanic. People of Color, boycott this place.

To be clear: the pizza here is excellent. But you've had better, and if you haven't, you should keep looking. Usually packed, I went most recently on a Tuesday night and was met with a comfortably filled restaurant with tables to choose from. Very nice. The decor is simple and relaxed and very welcoming. The lighting is appropriate and the mood lively, but not overwhelming. The menu is pizza and calzones, and they do them well.  The ingredient list is more limited that you might expect, and to be frank, the toppings were scarce on my portabella, basil, garlic and onion pie. Lucali is BYO ($5 corking fee), which is a nice plus, considering the pizzas cost over $20 for a basic cheese pie. Considering the unheralded but superb South Brooklyn Pizza is just a few blocks away, I'm not sure I need to go to Lucali's again anytime soon, unless its to satisfy a friend's desire to go to this hallowed pizzeria..."

I stumbled upon Eight Turn hungry for something warm, yet light to escape the terrible weather outside, but I was a bit disappointed. From all the Yelp reviews, it looked like the shrimp and avocado crepe was a good choice so I ordered that. While they certainly craft their creations with much finesse and artistry*, I have to say I didn't quite like the taste. The fresh avocado and baby spinach were wins, but the Thai chilli sauce was overly sweet and I really wished the shrimp had been grilled and/or marinated in something. I also ordered their popular Lychee Valentine crepe, hoping that would be better. It was, but only marginally so. There was a little bit too much of the rose custard cream, but the edible rose petals were an interesting addition. I do have to say though that even though this place is TINY (literally only a couple of barstools and a small bench) and gets crowded, the two people working the day I was there were SUPER nice and friendly. The cashier even pointed out to me that the paper bag I was carrying was ripping from the rain and offered me another plastic bag before I even noticed the tear myself. I came armed with an $18 PayPal offer, but without the deal, the prices are a bit steep, with the average crepe being $9. TIP: I noticed this too late, but the paper they wrap the crepe in is specially designed for you to eat gracefully. Look for the perforations so you don't end up looking like a cave(wo)man like I did. --------------------------------- *You can actually see them make the order given the open kitchen style of the place."

I'm not exactly sure what the dress code is because a lot of men were casually dressed, some women too. To the left is a Free, and I repeat, FREE coat/bag check. Which is again, awesome! It's much smaller than I expected. The bar is slap dab in the middle in a oval shape, leaving the front right corner with seating, and tables towards the DJ booth. No one came to greet us, so we wondered towards the back area and saw the set up. I asked a bartender if that was the table I reserved and she told me it was. The waitress, I forgot her name, was super sweet and attentive. She came back MANY times to see if we wanted drinks or to order any food to the point where I felt bad that I was taking up her time.. It was just the three of us so at some point they asked if they could take one of the tables (they were pushed together) for other guests which was fine, I still had enough for when my two other friends arrived. I didn't have much to drink, just a shot and 2 rum and cokes that I paid full price for. Which was disappointing because it was partially why I chose the lounge was because of the pictures that show a Happy Hour until 10 on Fridays. Not true!  The drinks were slightly watered down. The bar was packed so no biggie. To eat I had the Salmon that comes with rice and Bok Choy, delicious, I also tasted my friends. Jungle fries are good, as well as the Bibimbap. The waitress noticed the change in my party size and asked if they wanted anything. Again, super attentive. One thing I didn't like is that at 10:30 they take tables away, but I was already aware of that when I made reservations. I did leave the lounge a couple of times to talk and had no problem getting back in because the bouncer recognized me.  It started to get crowded around that time and people were dancing right next to our table. The DJ played a pretty good mix of R&B, 90's-00's Hip hop and Reggae/Dancehall. The crowd seemed consist of a lot of Asians, though there were some sprinkles of White and Black.  My only complaint is that it was SOOO crowded. People bumping you, crowded. We spent time taking turns sitting down to make sure our seats or dance area wasn't taken over. Overall it's cool for a couple of drinks, and some dancing, I just wouldn't do group thing there again."

The drinks are quite affordable at $6 for a pretty nice place in prime Williamsburg real estate. They also allow you to reserve tables for large gatherings which is super cool if you want to have a birthday or celebration planned here. Bartender service is fast, no hassles, and on point.

Although it's known for its hotpot, I would actually recommend coming here and trying several of the smaller dishes instead. The small plates are awesome. I would give Hakata 5 stars for these alone. These hot and cold plates are generally in the $10-15 range, and while they are not huge they are decently-sized, delicious, authentic, and well worth the money. Think of it as Japanese tapas. The gyoza were probably some of the best dumplings I've ever had. The pork belly was deliciously umami, and the spicy tuna carpaccio was excellent, with thick slices of tuna sashimi. I even liked the grilled intestine (which I don't usually like), it was fatty and slightly crisp with a hint of delicate organ flavor (sounds disgusting, but it worked). We did also try the hotpot, and while it was fine, I'm not a big fan of pig's feet (although it was good, for pig's feet) or hotpot in general. The hotpot was a bit lacking in the meat department, giving you a total of 2 dumplings, ~4 pig's feet, and maybe about 4 thin slices of pork belly. There were a lot of cabbage and chives though, if you are into that sort of thing. For this reason, I thought $17 per person was a bit too much, and would probably not order the hotpot again (except maybe to try the ramen at the end next time for an extra $5). In any case, I had to knock off a star for the hotpot. Prices have gone up a bit from the menus floating around online. The signature hotpot is now $17 per person, with minimum of 2 orders. The pre-fixe is now $46 per person, for 5 plates (to share, I'm assuming), hotpot with ramen/rice, and dessert. However, they've recently gone the Japanese way and no longer accept tips, which is awesome. Also, it's cute that the waitress follows you out when you leave and offers you Pez from a dispenser. I would definitely come back and order 5-6 small plates to share between 2 people. For that, this place would be amazing."

We were seated right near the bar and it gave me a moment to take in my surroundings and appreciate the French Bistro ambiance: dark wood, large windows/mirrors, steel/brass accents, and cute men in Oxford shirts with theirsleeves rolled up.  Sexy and attractive.  Oo la la. Prior to receiving our entrees was a basket full of sliced fresh bread and since they were from the bakery next door, there is such thing as perfection when warm bread is topped with real butter.  I ordered the Steak with Frites, rare, and was not disappointed.  The juiciest flank steak topped with a generous little coat of french fries.  I was in heaven.  Our host elected for the special of that evening, Scallops Risotto.  The dishes were simple.  Elegant.  And broad enough to ground out the frou frou effect.  Pricier than most nice restaurants in SF but prices are typically 5% more in NY.  Check out the late afterhours menu where there are other items such as hamburgers listed at about $10-15 less than the dinner menu.  The fabulous restaurant is open until 1:00 a.m. to support the city that truly never sleeps. The wait staff here are quick and attentive, not to mention active.  Our waitress was out and about all over the floor and would never once forget to keep our water/wine glasses topped off.  I was impressed, given the fact that we had a late dinner on a busy Friday evening.   When I'm in NY I will stop here for my Steak and Frites fix."

The fries were delicious and topped with something that made them ""spicy"" fries - whatever that was made them yummy!

I imagine that sitting by the windows provides you with a wonderful people watching vantage point.  I did also like that the menu seemed to change pretty regularly - I think that's a cool way to do things.   The only negatives I'd say were the fact that it was located far out and that the food isn't really all that surprising or all that creative.

I had the Sourcream Hazelnut Waffles with berries. The waffle came out very quickly, but was lukewarm, a bit tough, and had no flavor that resembled hazelnuts. The sourcream? In a ramekin on the side of the plate... I thought it would have been baked in for a moist texture. The berries were good, they get some credit for that. There were also almost no (eggless) vegetarian options for my boyfriend, who had a green salad and some fries. He was happy enough with both, but again, for an iconic NY restaurant, they could do better, Toss some portabello or aubergine sandwich on the menu! Also, the prices are VERY high for what you get, compared to even some of the nicest brunch places in the city. I couldn't help but notice that they charge $16 for ""eggs any style"". Though the restaurant is packed and the tables are close, we did have enough room around us. That was until our waitress repeatedly pushed herself into my boyfriend to get through to the people next to me, without so much as an ""excuse me"". It just made us feel like second class citizens (yes, we were surrounded by tourists, but come on!) I love McNally's other spots (Schillers, Pulinos, Pravda, Pastis) and was really expecting more from this NY icon."

The atrium area was PACKED with people waiting three-deep at the bar and pushing up against the door. So, we waited about an hour for our table (although we had a reservation) and as a way to make up for the inconvenience, our waiter gave us two free ""snacks"": fried spiced hominy and baby felafels with yogurt sauce. The spiced hominy was AMAZING and I completely stuffed myself on it as my friend that I was with doesn't eat fried foods (all the more for me!). We shared a great duck entree and the suckling pig.

We were seated in what might be considered the worst table, kind of in the middle of the place, adjacent to the open kitchen, honestly I didn't mind it at all. My companion and I ordered a bottle of Lambrusco (I think $36) which was divine and came with the cork and taste presentation. The wine bottles were all pretty reasonable prices with a good selection around $35, and their cocktails were in the $10 range. We ordered the fried calamari, and although it was just a touch over cooked, the batter was very light and super pleasant. They also include the tentacles, which I LOVE, and a side of marinara which was delish. I got the handmade parpardelle with lamb ragu and it was very tasty, my companion had the penne a la vodka and wasn't complaining! EVERYTHING needed salt, however. I think this is what is causing other reviews to comment on lack of taste. I do appreciate them under-salting, however, since Italian food, and fried dishes can be heavy handed. So I liked being able to control the salinity of my dishes. But the salt shaker was itty bitty teeny tiny, about the size of a single die (as in, one of two dice) and I spent a lot of time shaking it trying to get it out. For desert, warm chocolate cake and a 5 star tiramisu rounded out our perfect tab.

It was so rich tasting but very light at the same time. Two things that were less than stellar; Pear Ginger Juice. Not bad just meh and not enough ginger for it to be really fun. And the chocolate bread pudding was actual chocolate bread made into a traditional bread pudding. Again, neither good nor bad just weird and I wouldn't order it again. I also liked the bathroom just because they have those really good quality durable disposable napkins to dry your hands off. This place is smallish but it doesn't feel cramped at all.

And honestly I don't think the cornmeal breading really added. After all, most of the crunch will be coming from the bread in any event.

Totally had the fried chicken with pancakes drizzled with honey--the boyfriend loved that. There were 2 beers in particular he wanted to try but they didnt have it that night so we will have to come back (brunch!). The pickles sampler was amazing! Loved every one of it!!!! The biscuits reminds me of corn bread but better--i totally fell in love with the spread..i think it has maple syrup in it and unsure what else was in it but it was so so so good. I had the pork belly mussels which was yummy. Mac and cheese was a must. Some people did order the turkey leg and thought it was dry. The drinks were strong enough and tasted good. Well, i did hear the bloody mary was a tad bit on the spicier side. The food was really good and everyone took home leftovers because we ordered way too many appetizers to begin with. But the whole party of 17 said the food was reaally good and they would definitely come back. They kept asking me where did i find this restaurant!!! (Thanks Yelpers!!! The staff was very attentive with refilling our drinks and i believe the manager (not sure of his position) even came over to make sure our party was ok and if we needed anything. The guys really liked the music that played all night lol boyfriend ended up asking the manager about his playlist. It was a little too dark in the back seating area. We all had to use our phone flash lights to read the menus LOL its probably brighter during the day but night time, it was dark!

We arrived at 3pm and the restaurant was still busy with people which I took as a good sign and we walked in and were seated quite fast. However, that was the only good part about our visit. After we were seated we got menus from our waitress, and were given 30 seconds to decide what we wanted to eat. YES, thirty seconds. After she gave us the menus she grabbed us some water and asked straight away what we wanted to order. Since we hadn't had a chance to even open the menus I asked her to come back, and with she replied ""Okay, I'll be back in a minute"". She came back one minute later and stood at our table stressing us until we hastily decided on a burger each as well as coffee. As we waited for our food I noticed that the restaurant had cleared out, but every ten minutes there were a couple of people arriving and getting seated. Not even close to busy though, hence my confusion why our waitress was so stressed out. However, here was the point when I started to get annoyed. People who were seated after us were getting food before us (even though we ordered earlier) and when our coffee came the waitress had spilled half of it out so that the table was wet - and she didn't make an attempt to wipe it off. Our food took more than 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen, and what we got was quite tasteless. Meanwhile we were eating, I saw that the manager was multi-tasking. By that I mean that he was grabbing bites every 5 minutes from a plate in the middle of the restaurant, while he was either talking to the waitresses or the hostess. I just considered the whole thing to be very odd. My boyfriend finished before I did, and they removed his plate immediately which made me feel stressed to finish my dish. And the check arrived before I had even finished my meal. If it restaurant was full, I would understand if the staff was stressed to get us out of there. But since it wasn't even half full any longer I just don't understand why 1. Our waitress was so stressed out about us ordering/eating/paying/leaving. 2. Why our food took so long to get served to us. To conclude, our lunch experience here was not as pleasant as I would have hoped it to be. Especially considering the good reviews. I do hope however, that if we decide to go back here hopefully we get to experience the great service as well as quality of food that the other reviewers had the pleasure to."

That said, I found the rolls quite tasty. My lunch date and I shared three rolls and it was plenty for the two of us. I found it interesting that they don't have forks and knives here -- at first I was a tad irritated but then I thought, kudos to them for being environmentally friendly. No the rolls are not huge -- however, for those of us who count calories, that's probably a good thing. They have a nice selection of Snapple beverages in addition to the standard Coca-Cola fare. We arrived at 11:45 on a Wednesday -- good move as there was no line and seating was plentiful. The table near the front window is especially nice since it's not near the others and you have a nice view of the street. Kati Roll is fun and different -- definitely worth at least one visit, even if you're not an Indian food fan, like yours truly."

It's very busy, therefore loud, but they have the music on as loud as possible. Meaning, everyone is yelling to everyone else and the whole place is just ridiculous. Also, our waitress seemed to be a bit clueless. She came to our table once, we had to yell and flag her down just to order, and she spilled water all over my friend and didn't acknowledge it.

They ask you first what you'd like to see and what you don't like, to better get an idea of what to serve you. We had a starting complimentary small cup of soup, followed by 10 dishes, and ending with 3 desserts + a complimentary fruit bite. Out of our dishes, I highly recommend the scallops if they're part of the menu. Everything else was a combination of interesting flavors. We left either satisfied or stuffed.

The reason why I am only giving them 3 stars, however, is because while the hostess was totally warm, and welcoming, she quoted us a 35-45 minute wait when in actuality, we waited close to 1 hour.  Further, there was a bit of an issue with ordering an appetizer (we got the shrimp quesadilla which was yummy!) and not having it be brought to the table (as in, we could only eat it at the bar) but luckily, the manager made an exception considering we had been waiting for so long and just wanted to be seated.  So, we ended up having the appetizer brought to the table and ordered our entrees which came pretty quickly!

Everything taste sweeter than at other restaurants. It literally is sensory overload. The roasted rabbit is to die for although the polenta which it comes with can be soggy and cold. It's one of the few places that has fire-roasted rabbit seared crisp on the outside, moist and sweet on the inside without it tasting too gamey. The service varies.

Went here for dinner and got seated in the outside garden. The setting is lovely, intimate, and great for a date. Unfortunately, it's also mosquito-ridden, to the point where I was using my napkin to cover my legs for extra protection. A family seated near me had actually brought their own mosquito repellent - smart move. We ordered the anchovy crostini and the mushroom and truffle oil crostini to start. Both of them were delicious, the anchovy being the favorite. We chose the pork braciola and a linguini with marinara and crab for our entrees. The entrees took forever to come out. I'm pretty sure that it was due to the party that they were hosting in the back room. I get it, but it really was to the detriment of the other customers. Still, I would have been okay with the wait if the dishes had been good. Sadly, the linguini and crab was extremely bland, surprising for Frankie's usual standards. The red sauce had almost no flavor and the crab seemed a bit mushy. The pork was pretty tasty, but both dishes were served lukewarm, which was very unappetizing. It took an equally long time to flag down our server to pay our bill. While this place is usually very good and I would still go back, this was a rather disappointing experience."

I've tried some bites of their other dishes that friends ordered and everything tastes so good.

It was either that or a two hour wait (or perhaps the more logical, find another restaurant). Starved as we were, we took the table. Which, turned out to be possibly the most ghetto-fabulous spot in the entire restaurant. The table and chairs looked as if they were wedged in on an afterthought: I was seated against a locked door and a staircase leading to the bathroom. But, even the amazing feng shui of our table couldn't derail me from the great food, wonderful service, and did I mention the food?! SERVICE: The waiter was very polite, and very knowledgeable. We asked a million questions being that we had no idea what was what on the menu, and he answered everything with patience, off the top of his head. As per his suggestion, I ordered the duck confit. FOOD: (duck confit, steak and fries, and sorbet) The duck was amazing. The waiter explained that the meat would fall right off, and boy did it ever. The bed of salad, wild mushrooms, and potato crisps the duck leg sat on was delicious and a great compliment to the duck. But the duck, oh my. The skin was so crispy and excellent with the tender duck leg. I inhaled it and rolled out of the restaurant. SO good, I'll dream about it for a week. (Of course, it's only fair to say I was very hungry, and I do love duck, so this may have been the perfect dish at the perfect time.) As for the fries, I stole some off my friend's plate. They were very good, but nowhere near ""the best fried food"" ever. Tasty, and just a bit overrated. When I had a bite of my friend's steak, I thought it was very tasty, but he said the cut wasn't as good as other restaurants, and it was good, but not amazing. He agreed my duck was amazing though. For dessert we shared a sorbet with mango and strawberry flavors. Still great. Nothing to write home about, but delicious nonetheless. So, by the end of the night, I was full, happy, and couldn't stop gushing about the duck. The price isn't too outrageous--it's affordable, but definitely not cheap. My duck was around the mid $20s and the dessert was $9. You should probably make a reservation before you go. Either that or I hope you have patience. (Or, you could be equally as desperate and attain our ""VIP"" seating.)"

Atera is like that new kid on the block that is trying a little too hard to be ""hip"" and ""in"" when in reality it just makes the place feel a little too hipster for me. The restaurant was kind of difficult to find as it was located inside a doctors office type building?  It kind of seemed like it was trying to be a ""secret"" place.  When you enter you get taken up the elevator to this dim waiting room/bar area where it was set up in a way with just a few couches that it seemed like a place to go mingle with other couples or people.  Mind you all the other couples waiting around kept to themselves just like us.   It made me feel a little uncomfortable being kept in this tiny little room with all these people i didn't know.. and I was super relieved to be fetched by someone to take us up to another floor for dinner. Upon entering the actual dining room, i realized the layout was pretty cool with the kitchen being the main focal point of the room and the seats in the house are circling the kitchen in a bar stool type manner.  Cool yes, but also uncomfortable to be sitting on these stools for 3+ hours. As far as the food goes, the tasting menu was a major let down for me now that I've tried both Per Se's and Eleven Madison Park's tastings.  How did this win best tasting???  Yes, the selection is ""unique"" and ""different"" with quite a selection of unusual picks like monkfish liver, pigs blood crackers, duck heart ragu, and purple beets dipped in beeswax... but none of these items were in anyway palatable to me.  Out of the box, maybe but I don't see how these items justify a $300 price tag.   Now if you were looking for a place to impress a date, and you had $600+ to blow on you and your partner.. this might be an interesting place to take them.  The place felt exclusive, like you had to be in the know how to be there.  But if you want a delicious hearty meal, I wouldn't come here.  Especially if you happen to be a picky eater."

We were just looking for dessert after wandering out of our subpar Greek food experience and were delighted to find this wonderful bar/restaurant. Now here's a tip for the management from someone who's in the business. The two most important things you do to make money are collecting money and taking the orders. There was a single server, who seemed to do a good job, but was overwhelmed in the front. The food came out near instantaneously so that tells me that the kitchen is well staffed and trained. But for you to make money, you need to be able to intake orders quickly. It also makes the customers happy. That's my only complaint, you need more servers. Now we had the biscuits and gravy and they were great. The dessert was some kind of a biscuit with ice cream, but tons of ice cream. There was 3 in our group and we could not finish it but the girls wanted to finish it. We painted Manhattan red with our food excursions and this was unanimously our favorite place. It was just right down the street from where we were staying on Upper West Side. Loved it here, till next time..."

Geez.  The wait time is crazy long, people can wait 2 hours and still not be turned away nor discouraged.  After trying so many of their dishes, NOW I KNOW WHY it was worth even 4 hours of waiting!!!   The wait time is insane because during weekends or peak times, the place has sort of limited seating and a huge crowd.  The reason is because the food is SOOOO FRESH.  The noodles are home made, as depicted in the pics but you can taste the freshness in all of the ingredients. My party and I ordered a lot appetizers ranging from the sushi to a chicken roll/wrap that had green tea salt (oh yum).  Then we also tried the pumpkin and shitake, that was ok.  In addition, we also had the shumai (very meaty), the enoki side, seaweed salad with dressing, and various soba and udon dishes.  All to share.  Then for desserts - it was AMAZING. I had no more room left but I saw the photos for the milk pudding and the green tea ice cream.  OH.MY MY MY MY MY.GOODNESS.   The milk pudding was freshly made daily - and they poured the FRESH strawberry sauce on top.  It was decadent.  Then, I did not think green tea ice cream is ever a big deal since most Japanese restaurants serve it, but one taste and it was like heaven.  The green tea ice cream was not sweet but rather it had the matcha type of flavor to it, and that's PURE AMAZING!   This is as authentic as it can get without traveling to Japan.  One bite of the soba/udon noodles takes me back to the Japanese shops where they made their own noodles.  It was truly a world-class experience.  The prices are not all cheap but it's definitely not Megu/Morimoto/Nobu prices either.  I think it is well worth the wait and the cost if you do not mind fresh ingredients and dishes. Service is very very up there so I gave extra gratuities for the hard-work.  I am very impressed with this establishment, it's culture that they have maintained and their overall appeal to their patrons to make them wait without any disappointments.  I feel very proud of businesses such as this, that would draw in committed and a diverse crowd.  I noticed foreigners traveling from Europe and Asia at the restaurant.

But moving on to the three dense buttermilk pancakes with cinnamon butter, and some sort of compote with caramelized bananas...  The middle of the last pancake was actually not cooked all the way through but the batter was delectable anyway.  Just sweet enough, creamy goodness.  I tried convincing my date that it was intentional on the cook's part.  Then I nibbled on some of the salad and the biscuit that came with the Cookshop Scramble and was amazed at how sweet the carrots(?) and radishes(?) were and how divinely savory the biscuit was.  I would've eaten all of it but alas, I couldn't even finish my 3rd pancake.  My coffee came out way later than my friend's OJ but our server assured us many times it was on its way without my having to remind her.  (Love the small metal cup that the milk comes in!)  Lastly, the spiced fries are a winner.  Normally I don't like mayo but I found myself dipping more into it than the ketchup, which tasted a bit too sharp with the spice on the fries. In general I love places that make everyday dishes with fresh ingredients and know how to add simple tweaks that redefine expectations.  Cookshop does just that.  On top of that, like several previous reviewers noted, the ambience of the place is refreshingly airy due to the high ceilings and the natural sunlight that easily filters through the floor-to-ceiling glass walls.  I haven't tried too many but so far, this would have to be my fav brunch spot."

Our waiter was actually quite attentive, and we were surprised at the finesse he had in regards to responsibilities of his job, considering how young he seemed. He seemed to know when to approach the table and when to give us our space. Loved the ambiance and decor - definitely my style of place. I won't waste time describing it as I'm sure you can check out the pictures shared by other Yelpers. It was early-ish for dinner on a Saturday, so the restaurant wasn't packed, but there were a few other tables occupied at any given time during our visit. Oh, and the music was a nice, eclectic mix and wasn't played too loudly. We opted for the arugula salad with grilled halumi (that's how they spell it on the menu) cheese and a trio of mezzes to start. Enjoyed the cheese- not sure if it ""typically"" tastes like this but to me there was something about it that was reminiscent of a funnel cake or zeppole. Definitely had a ""deep fried"" and almost ""sweet"" taste. We didn't necessarily think the cheese was a fantastic pairing with the rest of the salad. It worked, it just didn't seem to make much ""sense"" to me. For the meze, we selected: Watermelon and feta tartare Hummus Burekas Okay, I don't know how you call something ""tartare"" if it's not raw animal product, but I loved the watermelon and feta together. The mint was a nice added touch. The hummus makes the cut but wasn't anything over the top on the excellence meter. I did like that there were some whole chickpeas in the middle, so that bumps up the hummus rating a bit. The burekas were delicious. Fantastic sesame taste, the pastry part was buttery, and the insides were great. I had ordered a glass of the white rioja and nearly forgot about it as I delved into the deliciousness of the plates around me. For the main course, we shared a chicken shawarma. I'm not a huge fan of chicken thighs and I ate my whole (half) portion. It was atop a mini pitia half, and adorned with some spinach (yum) and tomato (also yum). Nearly forgot to mention- pre-meal, they serve a grilled/toasted mini pita with olive oil and mixed spices, which we also enjoyed. We did opt to try the Turkish coffee for two and the baklava. The coffee was good but had more of a cardamom than coffee taste. I liked that the baklava was a little dry and crispy. Sometimes I like gooey baklava but to finish off this meal, this baklava was perfect. Another review claimed it too sweet, and I thought it wasn't overly sweet, but when things are homemade, you don't necessarily get the same taste each time. I would definitely return if I was looking to have dinner before/after an event, or for a small gathering with friends. We also found the prices to be reasonable and the portions were well-sized."

The pork comes on a dish elevated on a metal rack, I assume to try and prevent the pork from becoming soggy after cooking.  The dish also came with a nice heaping dish of cabbage.  The pork itself seemed to have been breaded in a very fresh panko bread crumb and was probably the best part of the texture.  The pork itself was a little too greasy for my liking, probably because the cut of meat was very fatty, but also because the grease they were using could have been used once too many times. Some of the pieces of pork were soft and chewy, while others felt like I was chewing on a piece of a leather sole.  The quality was average, I was a little disappointed that my friend had recommended so highly of this place when I've had slightly better at your local sushi take out joint. The overall service was a little long in the tooth, meaning the women were slightly old, but overall the experience was ok.  I might be back if I have a business lunch that I want to spend time going to, but maybe not an out of the way place that I would care to explicitly go to when I get a hankering for katsu."

The meat option (beef, chicken, lamb) have a good spicy kick to them, but can sometimes become dry if not enjoyed while it's still hot.  The Angelo shrimp roll has a pleasant sweetness to it and the potato one tastes delightfully similar to samosa filling.  The kati rolls are made to order, so even when you're the only customer there, it takes about 5-8 minutes to get your food.  Other reviewers mention that 2 kati rolls are very filling, but I find that I can almost always comfortably enjoy 3 in a setting - which is probably why I don't find the price for a meal to be as cheap."

It felt almost like Italy inside and we were happy to have our own red wine (with no corkage) given the byob policy.  The menu is about as simple as any I've seen and this is one of Lucali's strengths and weaknesses. Our first pie was a margherita but we added shallots, mushrooms and artichoke.  The large 8 slice pizza included fresh basil and the first bite introduced a wonderful tomato sauce that wasn't overwhelmed by too much cheese.  The thin crust was beautifully browned on the edges,  but I felt a slight disappointment over the crust -- it was good, not great, maybe it needed additional yeast or pinch of salt?  With hunger under control, we decided to live dangerously and ordered a second with pepperoni, garlic and hot peppers.  This pizza wasn't as good as the first, mainly because we shouldn't have included hot peppers.  The heat from the peppers obliterated my ability to judge the pepperoni.   Lesson learned or maybe our waitress could have steered us in a different direction.   We will visit again, but next time perhaps we'll eat a salad  as an appetizer somewhere else.   A simple arugula or endive salad before the first pizza pie could have added to the gestalt."

That being said,  let's get to it... Walking in,  aside from the awkward staring of the regulars,  the half eaten plate of food on the dirty table being the first thing we saw became an eye sore in what was such a beautiful restaurant. We were not greeted when we walked in but that was because there was no host,  no bussers,  no waitstaff...  Everyone just did whatever.  Our table was taken care of by two separate people so we didn't know who was going to collect the tip. We asked for coffee when we first sat down but didn't get it until much later (about 15 minutes).  I was already halfway through the water I received,  taking note that our glasses are the only waters without ice. When we did get the coffee,  we got it with whole milk (which the sweet waitress asked us what kind,  but gave us no options) but as I discovered that no one remembered to give us sugar with the coffee and sent the waitress to get some,  my date found things swimming in the milk. The waitress apologized immediately and fixed the problem right away.  About 10 minutes later,  that table with the half eaten food was cleared by the bartender,  but the table was never wiped down until the next couple took the table. I ordered the full breakfast ($20) while my girlfriend ordered the farmers skillet ($12). When the food came to us I couldn't help but notice that the farmers skillet was an omelete (there was no mention of eggs on the menu) with chopped sausage (probably not a whole link) not on a skillet,  but on a regular plate and looked exactly like my plate with the exception of the salmon cake and orange juice (portions were almost the same and still very small considering the price).  The salmon cake was about 1.5 inches in diameter,  bone dry, dusty and the orange juice was in a champagne flute ($8 extra?) the orange juice was very very fresh but the food was very lukewarm to cold.   Shame because the food was made with very fresh product,  well seasoned and probably would have been the saving grace to the sedimented milk for my coffee and the hair on my plate (absolutely no one wore a hat or hairnet), gross. The biscuit,  again,  very very tasty and probably the warmest thing on the plate,  not warm enough, though. I was halfway through my coffee and meal when that nice waitress came back to check on us. I said everything was fine to see if she would offer more coffee, but that was offered by a different person after I asked for a fourth time for the check.  Twice inconspicuously and twice directly and I watched them say okay,  then go off to do something else. The waitress did,  however apologize for the (extremely) slow service due to a large group that came in to eat.  However, that is not a good excuse for the secondhand service,  yet spoke volumes on her part as a front of house member,  because I didn't complain,  but no one was really hustling.   My patience ran out and I replied with ""I'm ready to go..."" when they forgot to bring the check and offered more coffee instead.  I was done by then, even finished my water to make it seem like I wasn't staring off into space waiting to pay and leave. When we left,  no one said ""thank you,  come back,  how was it?"" after seeing everyone who left get that treatment. So, we just walked out in this awkward silence with more stares from other customers... I think it could be a great restaurant,  it just lacks very much a team effort. Is hard to tell who was the host,  who was the barista,  I only guessed who was back of house by the aprons. The front of house also wore no uniforms with the exceptions of black shirts,  but some of them wore shirts with graphics,  jeans and Jordans, again,  no hats,  no nets and I couldn't catch anyone's eye because no one was watching the floor. I also hate to say it,  but I got a very big ""we don't belong"" feeling being there... The owner greeted everyone but us and there also a couple that came in thirty minutes later than we did and was served hot food earlier with ice water (in different glasses,  though) and left at the same time as us. I apologize to the restaurant and wish them the best of luck,  but I had a terrible experience and probably won't be coming back,  except maybe for the biscuits. Big, big maybe..."

I'm in lust with the lower east side as I'm beginning to feel it has the most affordable and delicious food. The Meatball Shop wasn't an exception to this at all. I came famished as I was on a drinking bender the night before and needed something hearty for dinner. Hoping that it was not as busy on Sunday night, I entered and was greeted by a mostly full restaurant. It was only me so I figured I could bypass all the groups and lines and snag a spot at the bar. I was wrong as a big hen party was occupying most of it, yapping away and drinking their perseco. No food to be seen. Maybe they already ate and we're just digesting over good, substantive conversation that didn't involve boyfriends or the new shoes they just got. Maybe I was just being a hater and voracious in my appetite. Probably the latter. Anyway the hostess was so accommodating and sweet. It's strange to say that but she was so friendly and kept assuring me in my 20 minute wait that Id get the first open spot. I was finally sat smack in the middle of the bar with access to the bartenders. I ordered a sangria, to my own dismay and eventual disgust, figuring it would go well with chunks of meat, Italian style. I had one sip and set it aside. Murky, bland water to me. I'll stick to whiskey. For foodstuff, I ordered the Naked balls, which is 4 meatballs and sauce. I got the spicy pork with spicy meat sauce. It was quite tasty though idda hoped the meatballs were seared when cooked to order. Don't they teach you that color = flavor in culinary school? Still, I enjoyed it with the meat sauce and sliver of focaccia bread. I also ordered the daily risotto which happened to be saffron infused. Good but nothing amazing. It was a bit too toothy and bland for my taste. I was still hungry after this, so I ordered two classic beef sliders; one with spicy meat sauce and the other with mushroom sauce. The balls themselves were okay, but the slider buns were quite inadequate and eventually fell apart in sogginess as I ate. I wouldn't recommend the mushroom sauce as it tasted rather of a generic style can of mushroom soup. Yeah not even brand named Campbell's. Good experience overall mostly because of the hostess and the fact I love sauced meat products.

Not overly sugary, the outside doesn't overpower the ice cream, delicate contrast of slightly chewy outside and cold creamy inside.

They taste as good as they look. Saturday evening around 8:30 the place was nearly full, but no wait at the time we arrived. We were seating on the bottom level (down the stairs) and not the garden area, which was fine with me because it was a lot colder in the garden and much cozier in the basement. The basement has a dark/wooden, romantic vibe. I saw a few tables on dates. Calzone - great portion, great taste. Comes with a (pre-mixed) blend of mozzarella and ricotta cheeses and fresh tomatoes. You can choose to add from a whole variety of ingredients to it if you'd like. It's cooked perfectly, not charred. Dough is soft and chewy. One suggestion - if you get this, definitely ask for tomato sauce on the side. It's a heavy, substantial dish and the sauce will lighten and freshen it. Margherita (sub gorgonzola for mozzarella) - great portion for one person and will fill you up, particularly because the crust is substantial. Perfect texture. It's 12 inches, but a real 12 inches. Many times a personal pizza isn't quite enough, but this one is great. Gorgonzola is medium flavored and delicious. Would highly recommend it for those who like the cheese, it's a good one. Ample tomato sauce on the pizza and good quality for sure. Will be back."

I ordered the popeye sandwich (spinach, falafel, hummus, salad in a wheat pita) with a can of coke and the total came to around $10.  It was very filling and they provided a hot sauce (greenish, I wish I knew the name but I am simply not familiar with the terminology) and a cream condiment, which both added a lot to the sandwich. My friends enjoyed their meals as well (one sandwich and one salad) and we all agreed that it was a good choice.

The bright and airy space is adorned with green plants and a chalkboard detailing the fresh ingredients and what farms they came from.  While the place does get quite crowded, the tables are set far enough apart to make for a comfortable dining experience.  So many restaurants in NYC try to cram tables as close together as possible to maximize seats.  Personally I am tired of being within elbow's reach (or coffee's spill....ahem) of my dining neighbor. We were seated and our server came by shortly thereafter as did our much-needed Sunday morning coffee.  We ordered the coffee cream doughnut and sticky bun to start our brunch.  The coffee cream doughnut was heavenly - fluffy sugary doughtnut filled with rich coffee flavored cream doughnut filling.  Dunkin and Krispy, take note!!!  The sticky bun was also yummy with toasted whole pecans and cinnamon sugar gracing its outsides.  I only wished it was served a little warmer.   My Cookshop scramble arrived shortly thereafter.  The eggs were scrambled delightfully (with some creme fraiche in them) as well as with my smoked bacon mixed in there...mmmm.  They were also atop a fluffy buttermilk biscuit just like mom used to make.  That's a lie - jews don't cook breakfast - we just buy bagels and cream cheese.  We have a penchant for breakfast carbs, what can I say!  Regardless my scramble was totes delicious and I could have probably eaten 3 more afterward. Portion control, Josh, portion control. My date got the poached eggs with pork sausage and pork jus over the white cheddar grits.  Heavenly.  My only qualm with eating cheese grits is that it is also Britney Spears' ""breakfast of champions"" (so said daddy Jamie Spears in her MTV documentary).  Although I am fairly confident Cookshop used real white cheddar rather than Jamie Spears' use of Velveeta singles since he ""ran out of sprinkle cheese"". As the Terminator says, ""I'll be back""."

The atmosphere (waiter, aura, menu, etc...) was a bit pretentiously hipster, but the prices (for the pizza at least) were reasonable, and my friend and I were not disappointed in the least with the pizza. We ordered the Millenium Falco, a pie with a perfectly light layer of mozzarella, tomatoes, some sort of delicious sausage, and a smattering of aromatic basil. The crust, additionally, was delicious, with the perfect blend of an outer crisp, and a bit doughier of a center. The beer on tap was a bit pricey, but gave representation to microbrews from across the country (along with the necessary option of a tall boy of Modelo Especial), and although we were unable to partake, the selection of after drinks looked to be quite adequate. I would recommend the pizza at Roberta's (only because I have not tried the slightly more expensive entrees) with enthusiasm, the only qualification being that, to enjoy yourself, you must be able to withstand a fairly inconsequential, but constant, din of pretension and punk rock.

Perhaps there's just too many of them there. I do love the ambiance, decor, and energy -- it's all very inviting.

I've seen the store on the corner of 4th and 46th change from nothing to a martial arts studio to Cafe Lore over a span of twenty years; and based on previous reviews and conversations with the owners, the premise of the restaurant is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and it certainly adds diversity to one of the most diverse neighborhoods in New York City. The interior is decorated with childhood photographs, music equipment, other random pieces. While the photographs emanate nostalgia and a sense of homeyness, the rest of it feels kind of thrown together, and dulled by the darkness of the walls. Cafe Lore seemingly strives to become a neighborhood fixture, and to create fun nights, such as poker nights, comedy nights, and music from live bands. Unfortunately, while you may feel this inside, the message feels trapped by the walls. The exterior decor is drab and somewhat uninviting. It's kind of hard to tell it's a restaurant from outside, let alone an Italian restaurant, when you're just passing by. Nevertheless, once you manage to open the door and take a seat inside, you are warmly and politely greeted by one of the owners. The food is as Italian food should be - hearty, satisfying, and filling - as I remember from my ""adopted"" Italian family who made well sure I was stuffed - quite the cultural shock when they would get offended if I refused their offerings, as customary in my own culture. ""What do you mean you're not hungry?! They're just meatballs!"" (despite the fact that they were the size of my fist. In the end I settled for one, which still accompanied under-the-breath grumbling.) The chicken parm is pounded thinner than I'm used to, and while the chicken could be seasoned a little more, the delicious fresh-tasting tomato sauce makes up for it. While I prefer my chicken a little thicker (thus more tender and juicier), the proportions of sauce, cheese, and chicken are decent. For $4, you can add a side of freshly made pasta with your choice of sauce. The spinach fettuccine with garlic oil is a good light side to pair with the chicken. Again, I could do with the pasta being seasoned a little more. You really feel appreciated as a customer here. The owners share interesting stories with you - about their childhood, their inspirations behind their food; and they truly express their gratitude. Upon seeing one of us clean our our plate, he couldn't thank us more, and was so happy that we enjoyed our meal. You can tell they really care about their restaurant and their customers. So while the food is good, but not spectacular, the warmth and welcome certainly carries the ball here, and maybe it's enough to get people to come back."

Once we had the first slice, we realize that just under half of the actual slices are all crust.  The cheese and sauce didn't reach down to a good amount of the lower portion of the entire pie.  So you get a few good bites of sauce (which there wasn't enough of), cheese and basil and then are left eating what tastes like plain flat crispy bread. The crust lacked any real flavor.  It wasn't too thin or overly crispy - it was just blah. The sauce was good - not like the tomato paste type in other places - but there wasn't enough of it.  The cheese - a good quality but used very sparingly.

The grilled seafood boat isn't as fun and isn't as filling as it didn't come with any noodles. The clams are large and juicy however, but because of that they take a long time to grill. The stuffed scallops with cheese are a bit unwieldy and also because they are in a thick shell takes a long time as well.

I live in the neighborhood, and after their ""tres leches"" dessert I told my hubby, ""I'll be coming back."" And I did. Only, to be disappointed and disgusted with my take-home leftovers. (Jump to the bottom if you want to get right to it.) There was a 20 minute wait, and we were seated pretty fast. We were probably seated at about 9:30. We were hungry, but based on our experience at Pio Pio, we knew that we would have to wait since they were very busy and there is limited space for the waiters to maneuver. It was approximately 9:45, and we still had not be served any water. We were seated right by the hostess, and I politely asked her if we could get some water (basically asking where our waiter was).  Alas, he showed up. We were super nice, and ordered the Matador Chicken and the pitcher of sangria (honestly, their sangria is my fave ever). Only, when our order came through, it wasn't the Matador Combo, but some other combination. I told my hubby that we should wait to tell the waiter when he came close. He never came close. So we ate our chicken, which was good, but it felt empty without the rice and beans. I tried signaling our waiter from afar, and that didn't work. I had to bother the hostess again (I tip my hat to you, as you did your work excellently). Finally, we get our rice from a nice man that was not our waiter. He was a actually the server. He stopped by several times during dinner to ask us how we were doing. I told my hubby, ""I wish that was our waiter. I'd give him a nice tip."" Our ""waiter"" stopped by once to refill our glass. When we were done, we asked for our leftovers, we paid, we tipped, we left. **Today, when we finally get to reheat our leftovers, my hubby realizes there is thick and coarse piece of HAIR entangled in the chicken. We were pretty grossed out. We compared the hair to our hair, and there was NO WAY it could have been ours. It was just too thick and deep black. He looks at me and stabs the fork in the chicken and inspects it. To our surprise we find TWO more coarse and black hairs!

Take one look at the menu and you can see this place prides themselves on healthy, fresh, quality ingredients. My sausage egg biscuit was delicious with a side of sweet potatoes. Biscuit tasted perfectly light and buttery and even my turkey sausage (which I'm typically not a fan of) was tasty. Initially I thought my gripe was I'd have liked more in the way of portion size. But hours later when I didn't feel bloated and sleepy, I appreciated not starting my day with a greasy, food-coma inducing meal. The place wasn't packed so the friends and I stuck around after our meal chatting and the staff didn't rush us out at all. True to its name, this place has a homey feel. I asked my friends what they would rate this place and most of them agreed 5-stars. A few of them disagreed and felt it wasn't a great value because of the small portions. But I thought about it and when I considered the ingredients, the service and the environment, this place definitely provided me with a 5-star experience. Probably won't have the opportunity to return anytime soon, but I definitely hope to be back!"

Cons: The restaurant is very small and there is limited space for mingling upstairs. With that being said, a server upstairs, who I am told was named Sean, was very rude and did not acclimate to the crowded bar area well unlike other servers. He was very demanding and inappropriate to guests that were just trying to grab a drink at the bar during their hour and a half wait.

It's all worth it!  The tonkatsu & curry are as authentic as their clientele--mostly Japanese diners. I'd give this place a solid 4 stars, if it weren't for the zero-ambiance, spotty-sometimes bordering rude-service, & pricier dinner menu. We usually come here for lunch, since it's cheaper.  There are 2-3 hearty dishes here that M & I both crave, especially during the colder months. Fresh, perfectly crisped breaded pork tenderloin in a sweet & tangy sauce -- *Tip to making a great-tasting tonkatsu sauce: Start first w/ grinding the sesame (it releases the flavor & oil of the seeds) w/ the pestle & mortar. Then, pour the sauce on top of the ground seeds & mix.  If you order the set course, it's served w/ AYCE soup, pickled daikon, & mounds of thinly shredded cabbage, which is served w/ the BEST ginger-sesame dressing ever! I could drink the WHOLE bottle but, instead, I always ask for another serving of their cabbage w/ this delish dressing! I don't want to go overboard but, after all, it's unlimited & I'm not into the soup (varies but, most times, it's some sort of watered-down miso w/ overcooked veggies) or the standard slices of pickled daikon anyway. I'm simply addicted to ordering & paying more for the ""Kurobuta Hire Katsu."" Berkshire pork tenderloin is prized for juiciness, flavor and tenderness & has a higher fat content - making it the best type of pork used for frying or cooking at high temperatures. The pork is evidently fried w/ freshly changed oil, which makes a huge difference in taste. A lot of other places reuse their oil..making anything fried in that batch taste rancid. Katsuhama's pieces of tonkatsu are perfectly crispy & light on the outside & tender and flavorful inside. I salivate just thinking about it..even though I feel like the pork sometimes is a little less juicier than the very first time I had it.  Could it be that they've become complacent because of their high ratings over the years & are now slacking off & making a less-than-perfect product? I also like their ""torikara namban,"" which is a Japanese style deep-fried free range chicken in a sweet soy vinaigrette. M loves the curry w/ the katsu.  The curry sauce is a bit spicy, peppery & tangy but doesn't come w/ the usual chunks of veggies that I've had w/ typical Japanese curry.  As usual, we share our dishes & I get to taste the best of both worlds! Over the years, the restaurant has introduced new items (& even sushi) to their existing menu. As appealing as they sound, you should really stick with the stars - the tonkatsu (pork) & curry!  You won't be sorry. The croquettes & other dishes-which I didn't even bother mentioning- just didn't do it for us. Lastly, flush down these hearty dishes w/ one of their $5 soju cocktails (plum, peach, & a couple of others i haven't tried yet).   Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"

We took the A train to West 4, and transferred to the M. We got off at Lorimer, walked north towards Scholes st. , made a right and walked one block to Leonard. The restaurant is at the corner of Scholes and Leoanard. We were weary about going in at first because it was nearly empty with the exception of two women sitting at one of the tables. We were greeted very warmly by a male wait staff who gave us the option of sitting wherever we wanted. We were given 2 simple wooden menus. One with the food, the other was a wine list. We were given ample time to look through the menu and make our choices. The waiter was very patient in answering our questions. I  loved that he said the lasagna would take about 25 minutes to cook because it was made fresh to order. We got a soft complimentary bread, along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We ordered the mozzarella, arugula and tomato piadini. It was savory, without the salt. This was enough food to keep us busy till our entrees were ready.  The food came out wonderfully hot. My lasagna was heavenly. The correct ratio of sauce to cheese and veggies. I used the complimentary leftover bread to soak up the sauce. Yummy! My daughter ordered the ricotta and mushroom ravioli. It was cooked to perfection and the gorgonzola sauce was creamy, not pungent nor overpowering. I loved both dishes. I ordered red wine which was not served in a wine glass. I found it odd, but I figured it might be the Italian way. We ordered the Tiramisu, which came with some very deliciously fresh strawberries. Both the male and female waiters were attentive, but relaxed. Testo has a casual vibe, romantic enough for couples, but also welcoming to families. There are about twenty tables and it has outdoor seating.The space is small, but it doesn't feel crammed.The bathroom is very clean. Later that evening candles were lit.   At the end of our meal we received complimentary shots of limoncello. Wow!

The metal tables, the communal wood table, the lights and exposed ceiling all lends itself to that hipster vibe. We were seated promptly after I mentioned we were there for the cider dinner and had tickets. The meal was delicious. Each course got better as it went along and paired well with the cider. We also ordered off their regular main menu- a mac and cheese and my boyfriend ordered a grilled cheese. The mac and cheese was super cheesy and flavorful. It was accompanied by a fluffy piece of cornbread. My boyfriend said the grilled cheese was delicious, though I thought it was overpriced for a grilled cheese.   Service was five star, but my friend noted that service isn't usually like that and generally when he walks in, no one really cares to seat/serve him.

My boyfriend tried the jalapeno and cheese sausage at Red Hook Flicks over the summer and swore we'd be there on opening night, and we were! We braved a thunderstorm, and it was well worth it. I don't eat red meat, so I was very happy to see that they have jerk chicken and a few meatless sides on the menu. The chicken was amazing. Sweet and very spicy. Based on the prices, I went ahead and ordered a half instead of a quarter and it was so much meat that I took a whole quarter home. My boyfriend got the half hog and another sausage (because he said it was too good to not get again), and he said they were both fantastic. My mac n' cheese was super yummy as well. Very reasonable prices for the quality. And they have a full bar with a decent beer selection. The ordering system for food at the counter and drinks from the bar is a bit odd. You order food and pay at one side of the room, and then drinks can either be ordered at the bar or brought to you by waitstaff and paid for there. I think they might need to figure out a clearer system in the days to come, but as for opening-night hiccups there were few in sight. Really friendly service and delicious BBQ. Welcome to the neighborhood, Hometown!"

They keep it simple, it's all handmade and brick oven, very homey atmosphere. Watching two strapping young dudes handmake your pizza by firelight is um, niiiice. The secret to any good pizza is two things - the sauce, and the dough. These guys use a thin crust without much flavor or complication to it - it's a stage for the sauce. Their sauce is where their magic is at - tart, thin, zesty and packs a lot of flavor. Pizza's a good balance for a girl like me, who loves carbs but also thinks of pizza as sauce+dough, and is not interested in a whole mouthful of edge crust to define her pizza. The calzone is rich, exorbitant (in flavor and heft, not price), yet, oh so delicious. It's big enough to feed a family of 4 or 5 alone (two adults, 2-3 kids). You only get one choice - ricotta. But that's OK, cuz it's hella good. On the day we came, Beyonce and Jay-Z walked up in there and freaked everybody out. But apparently they've been coming there for years. Good times."

The waitresses we had were a little scatterbrained and awkward.. sort of mulled around while we were eating, but never asked how we were doing... There are a ton of choices - from different styles of katsu to an endless list of appetizers. We opted for the ginger eggplant, tuna poki salad, a spicy cod roe rice ball, pork katsu curry, and pork katsu donburi (mixed with egg and served over rice). The beer is pretty cheap here - $16 for 60 oz pitcher or $7 for 25 oz. Food came out pretty quickly. I loved the poki and rice ball. Eggplant was a little overpriced but flavorful and cooked to the perfect texture. Katsu curry was delicious, but not mindblowing. Donburi was just okay, I loved the katsu itself but my egg white was still slightly raw coming out and there was a little too much rice.

This friendliness is just part of the vibe. The slow braised pork cheeks with soft polenta and gremolata were rich, tender pieces of meat on top of a giant serving of buttery polenta perfectly cut by the fresh carrots and celery in the gremolata. All three components created THE perfect bite. I dabbled in my friend's mac and cheese that was crusty on top and creamy once you dug in (my favorite way for mac and cheese to be cooked), and the French Onion Soup is just simply something we all should start every meal with. Even though I loved my dish, I spent the entire meal eyeing the steak frites it seemed like 90% of the restaurant was munching on and definitely plan on getting those next time. I was suffering from major order envy. Wine, bubbles, and cocktails are all super affordable. We had a nice bottle of Rosé for $50, and our server was extremely knowledgable in pointing us in the right direction with that choice. Thus leading to my favorite part of Balthazar, we were never rushed. The place was literally packed from the time we got there (circa 1:30) to about 4:30pm and our server only came by to refill our wine glasses, not push us to order dessert or pay the bill and get the eff out.

But if you happen to be in the area, I beg you to stop and take note of what you're about to miss out on. Ba Xuyen sells the best Banh Mi in the New York metropolitan area that I've had so far. The interior looks like your typical Chinese take out, except there's no visible kitchen within eye's view. It's simply a counter, with the menu plastered above, and two very friendly Asian women with big smiles. I opted for their #1 which is Banh Mi Pate Thit Nguoi ($5.00) and asked for it Spicy. Included in the sandwich are slices of Ham, Head Cheese, Pork Roll, Pork Teriyaki, & BBQ with Pate and Butter. Vegetables are also served in it, consisting of Cucumber, pickled carrots and daikon, Cilantro, and Green Pepper. In a few minutes, my sandwich was served and I was on my way into a blissful state of deliciousness. To begin with, the french baguette was of the utmost quality. Fresh, airy, with an excellent crispy exterior crust. It was far from overly flaky, that some Vietnamese banh mi's make the mistake of doing. Then came the meats and vegetables, all complimenting each other harmoniously. No one ingredient overwhelmed the next, something I'm much too accustomed of having too much pickled carrots and cucumber at one too many Vietnamese establishments. The fatty BBQ pork took it to new levels as well as the pate. Flavors of savory, sweetness, saltiness, sourness from the pickled vegetables. Textures of crispness, crunchy, gelatinous from the BBQ pork. Putting that all together equates to one very complex and superior banh mi that reigns supreme. There was nothing to really complain about, but everything to compliment about. But if there was ONE thing I could have critiqued, it was that the spicy version of the sandwich had only a hint of spiciness. Most casual spice eaters would not even notice. For those more enthused spice eaters, you may be let down. That crown goes to Nhu Lan's Dac Biet, which is in Chicago, Illinois. But don't let that get your hopes up. The #1 Banh Mi Pate Thit Nguoi is one fantastic sandwich that I will be back for, as well as to try their other banh mi's. If you're on a quest for the best banh mi, I highly recommend you make your way out to Ba Xuyen and give them a try. You can thank me later! It is definitely my go-to spot for best banh mi in the New York City area."

I visited Frankie's 457 one recent afternoon for an Ikea pregame after learning the Ballfields weren't open (WTF Monday?). Two friends and I split the chef's antipasto platter to go along with our salads. Big points for the marinated olives, green beans, and good quality prosciutto. I'll pass next time on the mushrooms and spicy salami, neither mindblowing. There menu's long on small plates-- salads, crostini, antipasti. I'd love to come back and sample lots of stuff besides the superb fennel/celery root/lemon/pecorino salad. A nearby table's big dish of meatballs inspired jealousy. You also don't see braciola too often on NY menus. I say the concept's great because Frankie's allows you to put together pretty much any meal you want. The low-key space imposes absolutely no expectations, and the wide selection of charcuterie yields many meal-sized configurations. But if one wants aps, a hot entree, dessert and coffee, the one can confidently ho that path, too. I say the execution needs a little work really only because of the two underwhelming antipasti and an avocado-beet salad that even this avocado and beet lover found a little too beety. Also: our waiter found an exceedingly awkward way of carding me. He sorta did this lean-back and stammered, ""Are you... of age?"" Which, I mean, if you're going to card me, fucking card me.

For our entrees, we got their dum bindhi (good), palak paneer (also good), and their bikaneri paneer (since I love paneer, this was what I would've ordered on my own and it was quite good). We were pleased to find out that there was ""unlimited rice"" with our entrees, and you can bet that we certainly got out fill of the rice.

First trip I had some chicken and noodles from the buffet. Dry chicken and overcooked noodles. Next up was a chicken cutlet sandwich. Chicken was rubber. My jaw hurt from chewing so much by the end of it. And they charged me 50 cents extra for cheddar cheese instead of American. Today I had a burger. Thin, overcooked, dry.

I had a late lunch here with a close friend of mine after a day of thrift shopping and it was a cozy little break from the madness of shopping.   We went around 3pm, a rather odd time for a meal I'll admit, but we had no problem finding a seat.  Although the weather outside was perfect, and others were enjoying the outside seating, we opted for a table indoors.  The decor was very cute and adorable.  It reminded me of a beach side cottage with its pastel colors and various postcards and snapshots all over the walls.  My only critique would be the seating.  My friend sat on one of the benches on the wall while I sat in a cushioned chair.  Maybe it was just my seat but the cushion kept on sliding leading to some slight discomfort and awkwardness. Onto the service, which was very good.  Our server/waitress was a beautiful woman with a thick French accent who I am pretty certain was the owner.  She was a delight though her accent made it somewhat difficult to understand but hey, it makes me wish I had taken French instead of Spanish in high school.  She was patient when my friend and I could not decide on which crepe to order. My friend wound up ordering a savory crepe, I forget its name but it had eggplant and tomato while I had a sweet crepe which had Cinnamon apples and vanilla ice cream.  The presentation was very cute and they both tasted wonderful.  We could not help but sampling each others crepe and vowing to come back and order both a savory and sweet crepe each.  Our bill only ended up being 20$  which I think is very good considering we got 2 crepes, salad, coffee, and juice. Overall Pates et Traditions is a beautiful little place with a friendly atmosphere, and delicious food.  It is somewhere I would definitely return to for a great brunch."

The ribs were probaly my favorite ribs i've ever had, crispy outside and falling off the bone and the glaze was perfectly balanced and very subtle. The tuna tartar was a winner. Served on tempura japanese eggplant was nice, sort of like an open faced spicy tuna sushi roll. The shortrib sliders were very tender and juicy and the sweetpotato fries were everything you could wish for when you think of sweet potato fries. The salt and pepper shrimp were ok. They were technically successful just not to my taste. The foie gras was served with a fried egg and fingerling potatoes which was fantastic sort of like foie gras for breakfast. And finally the scallops were perfectly cooked very sweet, and the pistachio brown butter with corn was an incredible combination.

U pick up your food, utensils, and drinks and hope to find a seat for you and your friends after waiting on that long line.  On the upside the slow service allows people time to finish eating so u can have a seat. They had the audacity to point out no tip when my friend signed her credit card receipt. We had the brisket, pork belly collard greens and mac n cheese and chocolate pudding pie Everything was delicious"

When I got to the counter ready to spit out my order in a hurry, I was caught off guard when the cashier asked how I was doing today. I think it was the first place after 5 days in New York that anyone asked how I was doing. He took our order and the transaction was pleasant and easy. We only waited about 10 minutes despite it being their lunch rush. It was also nice to be able to see them making the food. Always a sense of comfort in that. Anyhoo, we ordered a chicken tikka roll, mixed-veggie roll, and unda shami roll. The meat rolls were both exceptional and I'd highly recommend them. The chicken was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. It had just enough spice for a wimp like me. The veggie roll was good but I would have preferred a more homogenous blend of veggies since it was a bit heavy on mashed beets. Though very tasty, just not my favorite.   They give you wipes for after your meal, which is a nice touch. Plus they are located very near Bryant Park and it makes for a lovely lunch spot in Manhattan."

It's a small place, but you can't miss the AWESOME display of the crepes. That's what caught my attention at first and I was like OMGGG, I WANTTTT! Get the fuck in my tummy. I have a sweet tooth so I got the azuki berries and it was soooo good. It was gone in no time...it was just THAT good. OR maybe I was hungry (; the green tea ice cream was amazing though. One of the best green tea ice cream I've tasted. I could actually taste the green tea and it wasn't sweet like most green tea ice cream. THAT STRONGNESS. My girlfriend chose the savory shrimp avocado with truffle mushrooms and boy, did she enjoy it. I had a bite of it and it was like a food orgasm in my mouth. I can't imagine how it felt for my girlfriend when she tried it..probably just exploded in her mouth. I never really had a savory crepe so it was something new for me. The only thing that disappointed me was that the person working there forgot/missed my order hence the 4 stars. Everyone else who ordered after me got theirs before me. I had to wait like 30 minutes and my girlfriend was basically done eating her crepe by the time I got mine. They apologized and offered  me a drink, but I just wanted my crepe. I know it happens, but the guy who was in charge of my order didn't even apologize. The other two people had to apologize for him. ANYWAY, we're definitely going to come back here some time. I think I'll go for a savory crepe next time and I just hope they don't forget my order!!! DEFINITELY TRY THIS PLACE!"

I cannot believe I'm writing a review for Rao's!!!!!!!!! You are all probably wondering how the hell I managed to get in, seeing that reservations are currently booked through 2011 (not that you can get one past that. It's really about who you know), and the only exceptions ever made for a table have been for Presidents!! And even then, those were extraordinary circumstances!! Well, let's just say working for a certain Food Network show featuring Bobby Flay throwing down against Rao's (with Rao's winning) certainly helped get our entire crew into the restaurant for the premiere of the episode!!! When the rumor first started flying around the office about the possibility of getting into Rao's, most of us shrugged it off as just that, a rumor. As time passed that rumor became a certainty! We eventually had scored at least the ability to come in and hang out at the bar, but were told that no way would be get a table. In fact, I'm pretty sure they laughed when we asked! So we all arrive and as predicted were crammed up against the bar for the screening of the episode. When I first entered, Frank Pellegrino came up and introduced himself TO ME!! As we all stood there I noticed a cast member or two from The Sopranos! After Frank silenced the entire restaurant to announce our entire team (whoa!!) we all watched the Feast of the 7 Fishes Throwdown! As the episode wound to an end, a rumor popped up that holy hell Rao's was going to seat and feed us. O.M.G!!!!!! That rumor proved true!! We were all seated and served fresh mozzarella, tomato and red peppers, clams, and a seafood salad for appetizers. I had everything that didn't involve seafood and my God was I in Heaven!! Not realizing that that was just the appetizer, our faces lit up with delight as they brought out the main course of pasta with marinara sauce and massive meatballs (ha ha)! These were probably some of the best meatballs I've ever had. Of course, my only frame of reference would be Ikea's. : ) Frank noticed we had finished our first bottle of champagne, and upon finding empty glasses unacceptable, snapped his fingers and made another bottle of bubbly appear! THEN he proceeded to serenade us with a performance of a song he wrote and sang back in the day. My God. People, this was like having Frank Sinatra give a private performance. Think getting that table is impressive? Try this. WE TOOK OVER THE WHOLE DAMNED PLACE!!!! They ended up clearing tables out of the way and making a dance floor!! Frank put on some tunes from the famous jukebox (I will Survive, We are Family, etc..) and all the ladies (and some of the gents) got up and tore up the proverbial rug with him! When all was said and done, and with delicious Italian food in our bellies, Frank thanked us all for such an amazing experience, which again further floored us, as it was US that had the amazing experience! We all went home to our beds to sleep, only to wake wondering if it was all a dream. But no, it happened. Thankfully there are pics to prove it! I wish I could say that I would be back at Rao's soon. Alas, that will most certainly not happen. This was TRULY a once in a lifetime experience. Then again, we never expected to even get in in the first place! So hey! You never know! ...no seriously, this won't ever happen again. :  ) Thank You Frank and all of Rao's! And Congrats on your Throwdown win!"

The food was fresh and sooo good. We had the country style kabocha which was cooked pumpkin served cold in a sweet broth with mushrooms and trust me it was delicious. For dinner we had an udon with wild mountain vegetables, the udon noodles were thinner but just as good. We also had the Taco Set, spicy tuna and BBQ eel rool, ALL SO GOOD. For dessert we had the pann cotta which wasn't overly sweet and excellent texture. We also had two drinks, Iced Yuzu Ginger Tea and a muddled cucumber cocktail.

To be fair, given the fact that most gourmands are not at all impressed by Balthazar I'd never really paid attention to its location - but there it was, and it was opening at 9:00, so I figured I'd stop in for at least a pastry and a coffee.  Hopping in line minutes before the doors opened I was probably the 20th person in the restaurant - and it was bustling and full within 20 minutes of me taking a seat, a line stretching down the street.  Greeted quite promptly by my server and handed a menu I was offered a cocktail, water, coffee, juice - selecting a coffee I was asked if I wanted bottled or tap water - tap would suffice.  Seated at a cramped little table (even for one) I have to admit I liked the feel of the room - very ""French Bistro"" with the long bar serving chilled seafood and drinks and a menu focused largely on bistro/brunch fare. Returning shortly with the first of many refills of coffee - a deep and nutty blend, possibly the best I had outside of Daniel in New York (saying a lot as both Per Se and Picholine had excellent coffee) - I was offered the pastry basket with the words ""Can I bring you our basket of fresh baked breads?"" which I declined (I later realized this was offered to everyone, at $18, and most people did not expect it to be charged for because of the manner in which she offered it - there was quite the scene at the table next to me regarding this, actually.)  Instead asking for a single almond croissant and the Brioche French Toast to accompany the coffee my server quickly disappeared to give my order to the kitchen - returning within moments to manage 4 other tables with impeccable skill - honest to goodness one of the most effective servers I've ever seen anywhere. Returning shortly with my Croissant - still somewhat warm from the oven (or rewarmed) I was impressed by its girth and fluffiness - it stood tall with a nice crisp shell.  Unfortunately the interior of the croissant was largely doughy and most certainly not up to par with Madeline, Payard, or Petrossian.  Not that the croissant was bad - not by any means - but for $3.50 and Balthazar's famous breads I guess I expected an exemplary croissant while this was merely average. Merely moments after finishing the croissant I was brought my French Toast and my coffee was refilled yet again - while they were certainly trying to turn tables due to the growing line, I still must note how impressed I was with my server's cordial and professional behavior despite being very rushed (as it turned out I overheard her speaking to a colleague noting that the two of them were covering their own tables plus the tables of a server who was running late - even more impressive.)  Tasting the crispy bacon first I liked the smoky flavor a lot and found it to be well balanced between fatty/supple and crispy - while I'm not a big bacon eater, this was excellent.  Next pouring the chilled (should've been warmed) maple syrup over the toast I first taste the syrup - certainly not pure maple like Maialino, but certainly not Mrs. Buttersworth either, for the price I'd rather expected better syrup.  Tasting the buttery brioche I will note that the bread itself was sublime with essences of cinnamon and vanilla very pronounced - unfortunately while the outside was crispy and delicious, the inside was again doughy - a combination, in my opinion, of using too hot a griddle and not allowing the bread to soak long enough.  Again decent, but most certainly not worth the $18 price-tag. Receiving the bill and another coffee, this time in a paper cup to take with me, I have to admit I was a bit annoyed by the price - more than $30 when including the well deserved tip.  Obviously I don't mind spending good money on good food, but this was a case where I definitely felt like I was paying more for a name or hype than for quality or quantity.  Bill paid I made my way downstairs to the restroom and in the less than 2 minutes I was downstairs they had already taken down my table and seated the next couple - impressive.  Great service, a nice setting, decent food and high prices - in the end I have to say Balthazar was a nice touristy experience, but not someplace I'd return."

This restaurant recalls the aura and luster of french dining commons.  This isn't to say that this place looks dreadful.  Being that it is French, there is a lot of decor, design, and pattern to be had.  The cream walls illicit a glow from the lighting while the dark exposed mahogany-like beams, columns, tables, and detailing help to accentuate the richness. Even though we came for a late lunch this place was still packed from hungry shoppers.  The casual atmosphere permits loud discussions, sneaks and jeans, and beer glasses filled to the brim. We ordered a tasting plate of oysters, served with several dips and condiments.  It was delicious.  The portion of the oysters was appropriate to pricing but not humongous.  A good way to get some ""mojo"" back. I ordered the duck pie while my guest ordered the steak and fries.  My duck pie was very rich.  It's thick outer coating of potato and cheese layering certainly layered my stomach with goodness.  It was satisfying peasant food, but I don't think I'd order the belly buster again.  My guest's steak and fries was good as well.  The fries weren't anything to write home about.

The greens that came with it had sliced radishes and carrots, slices thin enough to just make them noticeable and added a nice crunch to the greens, all with a light vinaigrette to balance out the egg and biscuit.

Despite the fact this place is STILL a scene, Balthazar has an incredible wine list, phenomenal food, an accurate brasserie atmosphere, an awesome wait staff, and the food...the food is just amazing. The escargot are awesome -- I defy anyone to not consume half the table's bread sopping up the liquid gold in which the escargot arrive. Garlic butter good enough to drink or in which to bathe. The onion soup is both classic and perfect -- every time. I've had so many great meals here I can't itemize anything per se beyond listing: the turbot, the bar steak...yowza. Skate, Branzino, Steak Au Poivre, Duck Confit, and the Steak Frites...salivating just thinking about these myriad items and, more importantly, the consistency and the realization that it's been more than two weeks since our last visit and I'm wondering just now why that is. It's hard to put it into words, but even if you despise ""french"" food you can't help but love this place and its food. The only negative, if one can call it that, is it is not an inexpensive evening, but every time we've visited, we've wondered why it took us so long to return.

Having gone through all that I had high hopes for the food but unfortunately it came up a little short. Had the Gyoza and the Hakata Tonton Hot Pot which seemed like the two more popular items. The Gyoza was really good and would def eat that again. Didn't really taste the pig's feet at all. But the hot pot wasn't anything special in my opinion and wouldn't crave it again.Thought it had too much vegetables and not enough meat. Broth didn't really blow me away either.

NASU SHOGA ITAME - Sauteed eggplant with ginger sauce.  This was good.  The chunks of eggplant were very large, and I think they should have been smaller because the large chunks end up being huge bites of mush in your mouth.  But otherwise, the sauce was tasty. FRIED AVOCADO SKEWERS - This was not good or bad.  Slices of avocado, breaded with tempura and deep fried.  Served with more avocado, kind of like a flavorless guacamole, on the side.  Three skewers per plate.  If you mix the soy sauce and some of the other sauces on the table and pour over the skewer, there is enough flavor to make it edible.  That is all. TOFU CURRY - Beyond bad.  No portion of this plate worked.  The curry itself tasted like brown gravy mixed with indian spices.  Weird and gelatinous.  The tofu was a very soft, wet tofu that was cut into large pieces that were incredibly gelatinous as well.  Completely inedible.  The inside of the tofu looked like the white of a raw egg.  The tofu had been lightly fried, which created a skin on the outside.  Seriously.  It felt like skin.  The white rice on the plate was sticky but completely flavorless.   While the service was ok at the beginning, once the bill was presented the waiter disappeared for at least 20 minutes.  When we took the bill to the front and asked someone else to run the card, they asked us to please be seated while they located our waiter.  Which took another 5 minutes.  Overall not as pleasant of a dining experience as we hoped."

Being a frenchie myself I can tell you that Keith got the look down when he designed that one (as he did all his other restaurants mind you): it is REALLY hard not to feel as though you were in Paris the second you pass the door. But what Balthazar has that Paris lacks is the atmosphere: from the lighting to the music, the pretty host/hostess, the professional yet casual service, and of course, the crowd. You won't learn much about the food from me (I always get the same thing) but I can vouch for the escargots and the moules frites. A note of caution though: if you never had escargots before or are a bit on the fence, beware, those are the real thing, slimy and gooey and, soaked in garlic butter. You've been warned :) Although I'm fantasizing about becoming a breakfast regular there, I only go late at night, passed 10pm anyway. Not purposely, it's just the way it happens and turns out it's just the way I like it. Never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table or booth without a reservation. This place is a classic, a perfect combination of simple things that please all five senses all at once without you even thinking about it.

We were seated pretty much right when the hostess told us we would be which was good. Our food came out in average time. It was good, the portion sizes were what I hoped we would get for the money. THE BAD-ish: Service was just average. A little slow to take our order. Slow to pre-bus our table and never really checked on us during the meal. Also, the downstairs area for the bathrooms smells.....strong. The soap dispenser in the bathroom I used didn't work and everything just felt dirty. I just didn't feel the restaurant was as clean as I would have hoped. Food presentation was lacking a little. When they dropped off certain items, they had the oyster crackers just sitting on top of the sauce; not what I would like to see as a patron or a server. Wrappers on top of my food seems a little out of place when you're paying over $20 for an app. Overall I liked the food and the atmosphere but I won't be rushing back there anytime soon."

Brussels sprouts is like the new trendy side in most NYC restaurants but they do it fantastic here. Right amount of sweetness and crispy also slightly burnt that signifies that it was nicely roasted in the oven. The duck at first was served medium rare... a bit too rare for my taste so I sent it back and it came out in a perfect medium. The duck was sooo tender and the pickled fennel underneath was a perfect balance since duck can be heavy and also fatty.

The ambiance is interesting, on the night we went we heard lots of classic rock (Doors, Beatles). The decor isn't really what you would expect from reading the menu either. We seemed to be served by no less than 4 different members of the waitstaff, which made ordering both easier and more difficult because we never knew who we were supposed to ask for things, so we asked everyone and everyone responded. The little French ravioli are alright, I'm not sure I'm too into comte cheese (it was my first time having it). It had a very light, sort of sweet flavor. I ordered the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison ( Cannellini Beans, Carrots, Tomato, Garlic Duck Confit, Slab Bacon and Pork Sausage all Braised with Noble Duck fat, White Stock and Foie Gras Jus). Holy hell, the description that this dish is for warriors is spot on. This is super filling and rich. I wasn't a fan of the bacon, it was extremely tough and chewy. I was also expecting more of a stew-like dish from the description, but the dish is mostly beans. It's cooked in a casserole dish, and the top gets a crunchy crust, in some ways it's almost like a duck fat mac n cheese made with beans instead of macaroni. The duck meat was super tender and I focused on eating that and the sausage as the beans were just too much. My friends duck breast in cherry sauce was overcooked. They had a Belgian beer, Leffe, that was delicious and went really well with the Kassulet. While I left (very) full I can't say that I had a favorite dish.

I've been to the Meatball Shop a few times over the years.  The restaurant has an interesting and unique way of placing your order: mark off your meal with a black erase-able pen, from a laminated sheet that lists all possible options and combinations.  The food and service are good (not super great), while prices are a bit high. You start off your order by deciding what kind of meat you want the ball(s) to be made of.  In traditional Italian meatballs, there are multiple types of meat in the mix, but here you choose from: Chicken, Spicy Pork, Beef or even Veggie.  Step Two is to select the type of sauce for each of the ball(s).  Options consist of Classic or spicy tomato, Pesto, Mushroom or a Creamy Parmesan sauce.  You can make your ball into a slider or hero and do all sorts of things to it to get it the way you like.  In addition to the main attraction, there are a wide range of side dishes to complement your meat - Polenta, Mashed Potatoes, Salad, Pasta or Veggies AND dessert. Although i didn't find the taste of the balls to be exquisite, but rather the combination of available flavors were entertaining and satisfying.  My favorite meatball was the special of the day (or week, idk which); the Buffalo Chicken flavored balls.  I also didn't find any of the pasta to be really be up to par.  There was never enough sauce in our bowls and it seemed quite dry and over cooked. The best part of the meal really are the ice-cream sandwiches.  A massive scoop of ice-cream is squished between two cookies.  With an actually pretty wide range of cookies to choose from  (Snickerdoodle, Ginger, Brownie-Walnut, Chocolate Chip or Oatmeal Raisin), and your basic ice cream flavors, it is well warranted to save some room for dessert."

It's rare in Brooklyn to find a place that is this good without a major attitude. We went last night for a big group birthday dinner, the place was pretty quiet so we had no trouble taking a giant table for 20 people. Everyone lines up and gets their own food and drinks so there is no fussing over a split tab. The bartender was very friendly and let us taste their special blend red wine- it was light and fruity, a perfect foil for rich BBQ. The Q-master was extremely helpful and steered my girlfriend and I away from the dry brisket (they had run out of wet by this time) toward the most succulent beef rib we had ever tasted, it was meltingly luscious and rich with a seasoned bark, yummy with or without sauce, we also had the pork ribs which I was a little less wowed by but they were still delicious, the sriracha chicken wings which were a dream come true (made to order and delivered separately to the table with a sprinkle of green onion and cilantro and a sweet spicy sriracha glaze), the collard greens which were just lightly vinegar-ed and cooked to a perfect tenderness, and the whiskey pickles which disappeared very quickly. We definitely ordered way too much food but I was happy to taste so many things and take home some leftovers. The friendly owner asked many of our guests if they were having a good time and if they liked the food- and they were and they LOVED the food!

I requested a table for two and was seated right away. After looking over the menu the manager asks us to move tables to accommodate a bigger party. This is no problem. However, after moving tables the manager comes over again and says 'due to a miscommunication' we shouldn't have been seated and we need to leave our table and wait another 45 mins for the next table. Keep in mind - the manager did not apologize once for the error of his staff or even offer to make the situation right. The manager grabbed the menus out of our hands and told us to leave.

Once I start to eat this pizza, I become incapable of stopping until I've eaten so much that my body begins to shut down. My eyelids seriously start to hang heavy. Tips to maximize the Awesome (valid for any quality pizza place, btw): 1. Go with four to six people so you can enjoy as many pie varieties as possible. 3. Always start with the margherita (tomato sauce, cheese, basil) - it's the baseline pizza which really shows off how great (or not) a place's pizza is - and venture forth on the toppings from there! 2. Order sparkling water - it prevents the dough from making you feel quite as bloated, hence allowing you to keep your mouth in ecstasy for significantly longer.... you're welcome."

Hard to believe this place has been open 2 years already.

Menu items rarely change and some of the specials stick around for an entire season but at least the dishes are tried and true. There is something for everyone and the kitchen is happy to substitute for my vegan/gluten-free/picky eater friends. My only complaint is about the bathrooms. They are too few and pretty tiny but pleasant... except for the boring soap - get something that smells good please (which even nice restaurants seem to try and disguise by pouring into a nice container)! A pet peeve of mine. But I think this place is just as good food-wise, if not better, than higher priced Italians that end in ""O"" like Maialino or Ciano or Giorgio.

Ha, I know the subject has been beaten like a dead horse, but I would like to use it now to rate Lucali's 3.5!  Oh well, guess I'll be generous and bump them up to 4Stars. The restaurant is in an awesome neighborhood in Carroll Gardens. The space is smaller than I imagined with roughly 30 seats. My girlfriend and I had to wait about an hour and a half to be seated on a Friday night. We put down our number and found a bar close by. When we were finally called we still had to wait outside for them to finish cleaning our table. The owner was playing host and I struck up conversation. He was an extremely friendly Italian guy. Told me a little about he business and how he was looking to extend the restaurant with the store front next door for more seats and a bar. He recommend trying the calzone. When we finally sat down we realized there was no menu. Pizza and calzone were the only things to order. We got both. The calzone came out first and it was very good. It wasn't life changing, but I very much enjoyed it. I love the accompanying marinara sauce on  the side. The pizza was extraordinarily good, as well. Very soft crust and fresh ingredients. I knew Lucali's was considered one of the Best Pizza in the city and it met expectations. The reason for the 3.5 star consideration was I felt the restaurant was missing something. I couldn't put my finger on it. I don't know if it was the limited menu, the tiny size of the restaurant, the hour an a half wait, or maybe that they don't open earlier than 6pm but Lucali wasn't a ""HAVE TO COME BACK ASAP"" experience. It was good and I would probably like to come back, but it won't be first thing on agenda. To me Roberta's in Bushwick was on a whole different level.

The restaurant has a very lovely rustic feel to it. It was a bit dark for me the night we came but still warm and romantic.   The man escorting everyone to their tables, who I assume was the manager was very good to us. He was attentive, alert and friendly.  He immidiately took our coats and had us seated.  Once we were there I think he noticed that my husband and I were seated in a bit of a tight spot between two other couples, (I am 8 months pregnant and my husband is 6/2 with a football player's build) and he kindly offered us a table for four since that table wasn't reserved till 9:30. The seats & tables are very close to eachother.  We greatly appreciated that. Our server was great.  He was a tall blonde gentlemen with an accent.  He checked in on us often. He took our order and we recieved it as ordered (our churasco skirt steaks were cooked to our asking.  He was very friendly and attentive.  Our water was always filled and my husbands drinks came when he asked them to arrive during the meal. As far as the food goes, we were both disappointed.  Not because the food was bad but because it wasn't anything too extraordinary or wowing.  We had expected from  the popularity of the restaurant and the pricing that the food would be mouth watering, and it was just good.  I had the octopus appetizer and was disappointed in how charred it was, and how much the sauce tasted like just plain mayonaise. My husband's lobster bisque  was delicious.  The warm bread they give in the beginning was nice.  We had the churasco skirt steaks for an entree and the flan for dessert. My appetizer and the two entrees were pretty small portions.  The steaks were a bit small compared to photos we had seen but were pretty tasty. The flan was delicious.   Overall, I like Tabare.  I think its a beautiful restaraunt, the service is excellent and the food is well done and tasty.  However, for a $135 night I don't know that the food is worth that high of a price.  Perhaps, the crowded restaurant made consistency difficult to keep up.  We don't mind paying that I just don't think the food was worth the money.  I wouldn't mind returning and trying the food again because the place is beautiful and the service is fantastic."

The amount of chutney made the rolls a little soggy. I still loved the chutney itself, the flavors of both rolls were delicious, and the portion size was perfect. I recommend getting two rolls; they have deals for ordering in twos. The line was to the door, but it moved quickly.

My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed dinner Cookshop on a frigid January 2 evening.  Marc Meyer and Vicki Freeman bring us a third wonderful restaurant to compliment Hundred Acres and Five Points, neither of which have disappointed me in the past. Although the decor seemed to be modern minimalist generally, the walls were still adorned with holiday decorations and Christmas lights, both of which tastefully complimented the ambiance and resulted in perfect lighting for the meal. The service was tastefully friendly and attentive.  My water was filled with regularity without intrusion.  My only dislike was that a different waiter brought us our dinners than the waitress who took our orders.  Although this is a pet peeve of mine, that this was my only bone to pick is a testament to how good the service was. The food matched, or even outshone, the service.  We enjoyed the polenta fries and duck confit samosas.  Of the two, the samosas were a tad better but both were excellent.  If you love black olives (which I do), the aioli served with the fries is not to be missed.  In truth, I think 2 people need only order one app., unless you pass on eating the bread (which didn't shine) instead. For dinner, the suckling pig was great and, when eaten with the drunken beans, was better than the sum of its parts.  Perfectly cooked, I would highly recommend it.  The North Carolina cobia missed for me because the texture felt a tad overcooked, but I believe that is partially a product of cobia's natural texture, which is not dissimilar to mahi-mahi.  However, it was served with a wonderful mix and the plate was still enjoyable. Dessert, pineapple upsidedown cake, was excellent, although the rum raisin ice-cream tasted a bit light on the rum and more like vanilla raisin ice cream - much to my chagrin but to my wife's delight. All in all, the meal was $100 with tax/tip but without alcohol.  We were full to the brim (and then some) and overall very pleased.  My wife prefers Five Points by a hair (she has enjoyed dinner there, while I have only had their outstanding brunch), but all in all I would be happy to suggest this place to anyone in the (admittedly off-track) area. Definitely worth the trek and I would go back without hesitation."

Milanesas and good reviews drew me to the restaurant.  Milanesas are breaded and fried thinly cut steaks, but the milanesas here were made of veal.  After asking for the milanesa to be substituted with steak, the request was rejected. The owner proceeded to insult my knowledge with a snide comment after I suggested using a flank steak. Of course I don't know what I'm talking about because I rarely eat red meat, let alone cook it. I just figured an Argentinian restaurant could find one cut of steak in their kitchen for my milanesa. I opted for a shrimp appetizer with four shrimp, and had lost my appetite anyway. My mother's filet mignon was overcooked, tough, and left half-eaten.  My friend's pork chop must have been 95% fat, which made it absolutely disgusting (she shredded off piles of fat to find about five morsels of edible food). The place gets zero stars for food, and negative stars for service. FYI Porteño, tender veal is made from calves that are ripped from their mothers after birth, chained to the ground or trapped in a crate to prevent muscle growth, and fed an anemic diet. The calves do not have the simple luxuries of the affection of their mothers, playing and socializing, nor even moving their bodies or stretching out. Their only advantage in this misery is having their necks slit at a young age so that restauranteurs who live in a time warp can sell their tender meat. Porteño: There are other options, like ""famous"" Argentinian steak. But not here, apparently."

It feels like you are in Paris, very authentic. While it is very crowded and can get a little loud, I personally feel that this adds to the environment. And honestly if they had less tables I'm sure I would never be able to get a reservation, so the more tables they can squeeze in there the better! I've never been without a reservation, but I've been a handful of times and usually make reservations about 2 weeks in advance and have never had a problem getting a table at the time I want. I've seen many walk-ins who can either get a first-come-first-serve table near the bar, or wait anywhere from 20 m - 1.5 hours. (People actually wait that long and  yes, it's worth it). Now for the food.. Their raw bar is amazing and both of their seafood platters are a great value and really fresh and delicious. They're salade nicoise is one of the best I've ever had (I also regularly get the take-out version at the Balthazar Bakery next door) and their french onion soup is better than home made. The duck shepard's pie is super rich and definite comfort food, perfect for a cold day. Their onion rings are to die for and my red meat loving friends went crazy for both the steak frites and the steak au poivres (peppered steak). Oh and the bread for the table is fresh made in house and is amazing (I also like to pick up a loaf of the walnut bread from the bakery next door). And the service... Even more than you would expect from a higher-end restaurant such as this - especially one this busy. They were perfectly attentive while also tactful with timing and giving guests their space. Also should note they were not up-tight at all like some higher end restauranteurs often are, I've been with groups of my friends (in our 20's) and they've never been anything but very nice and accommodating.   Its the attention to detail that really puts them above and beyond. For example, when eating from the 3 tier seafood platter, as soon as you have eaten enough they will come and rearrange the food on the bottom two platters so you can see across the table again (and they will do it again onto the bottom platter). And when they serve you the seafood they put 3 bowls stacked in front of you so they can switch out your bowl of empty shells without you even noticing. I really can't say enough great things about this place. Have taken many out of town friends (and my parents) here and got nothing but rave reviews. Even got my dad their cook book for christmas because he was so obsessed with the onion rings."

It's an open kitchen setting, and you watch the chefs prepare everything in front of you, but somehow what was meant to be intriguing left something to be desired.  The chefs looked miserable, and watching prawn heads sizzle on a hot table was not romantic.  We tried 4 things and then cancelled the cheese plate we had also ordered.  We decided ordering a pizza on the way home was going to be more satisfying. Outside of the dishes/food, the staff was lovely.  This place looks like it will be pretentious, but refreshingly, it's not at all.  The waiter knew we were celebrating something and brought out complimentary dessert wine.  He was extremely warm and pleasant and was the best part of the experience.  Unfortunately however, I will not be returning to Degustation."

First, let me say that the reviews here are pretty much dead on.  I'll start with ambiance:  A small, dimly lit, understated little place.  Just two little rooms from what we could tell.  Seating is European style, very close.  And though it is quite loud and jovial (and this was a Sunday night!), it still felt incredibly intimate.  Definitely a place to romance someone.  The BYOB wasn't a problem.  They have some sort of setup with a local wine shop.  We called the wine shop, told them our price range and preferred type of wine, and shortly after we arrived, a courier  from the the shop came into the little restaurant and put the bottle on our table.  My husband discreetly paid him, and without delay, our wine was corked and poured by the La Sirene staff.  We saw other couples having their wine delivered this way, and still others bringing their wine with them. Appetizer:  I had the a pear poached in red wine with bleu cheese over top.  Sumptuous, rich, perfect temp.  The best I've had.  My husband had only a salad, but said that it was very good. Entree: My husband had the hangar steak.  He prefers his meat well done, but the young waiter who took our order explained that the best way to enjoy hangar steak was medium, and promised my husband that he wouldn't be disappointed.  That was an understatement.  He sopped up every morsel and claimed it one of the best steaks of his life.  With it was some sort of a squash puree. He said that it, too, was Delicious, but I was so busy with my cassoulet that I never got around to trying anything from his plate. The cassoulet....oh...the cassoulet.  It arrived in a steaming hot crock pot type bowl.  Upon the first luxurious taste, I wanted to roll on the floor, kick my legs in the air like a toddler and say, ""Yes!  Yes!""  It was that divine.  A combination of buttery soft cannelini beans, sumptuously rich duck confit with a hint of crunch to certain bites, and delicious sausage.  It does not disappoint. Unfortunately, after a bottle of wine, and the entrees, we could not manage dessert.  While we deeply wanted to try it, we were both stuffed, and to have ordered it would have been pure gluttony.

You can't throw a stick in NYC without finding good pizza - it's the water for the dough, right? And the basic ingredients. So why is it that if you arrive at this place at three minutes after they open their doors at 6 p.m. on a Saturday night on Labor Day weekend when most everyone has split town for the last big out of town bender, and ask for a table for 7, they say 10. Not 10 minutes, 10 p.m.!!! Obviously, they see the kids in our party and obviously, they don't have kids or don't like kids or simply don't understand that kids can't just delay eating dinner for four hours. And to be fair, I'm not sure how adults can agree to a four hour wait, either. Okay, so what if we split into 4 and 3 and ask for two tables? 8:30 p.m. Well, at least we're heading in the right direction. Unlike Grimaldi's, you can order a pizza here for take-out without waiting in a one-hour line. Okay, so let's order two pizzas to go and eat them in a nearby park. So we place an order at 6:07 p.m. for two pies, and we're told, come back at 7:15 p.m. I start laughing... Really? Yes, as the hostess explains, ""we only have one chef and he's got a lot of pizzas to make and if you want to eat at 6 p.m. when we open, then you should line up at 5 p.m., and wait"" My first thought is, ""Maybe you should hire another chef and maybe, oh, I don't know, double your production, and your revenue (!), instead of turning away customers, forever!"" My second thought is, ""Well good, I'm glad the chef is busy and it's a good thing people looking for dinner at 6 p.m. agree to patiently wait until 10 p.m. to eat or 8:30 p.m. at the earliest, and I'm glad people seem to enjoy it and don't seem to mind the 2 to 4 hour wait - for pizza! Unless they put truffles on those cheese pies, we'll go somewhere else where we can eat, like, closer to NOW, and where, lo and behold, the pizza is pretty delicious, because, hey, this is New York and it's the water that makes the dough and the bread and the bagels so good, right? And since it's pizza they might add some freshly made sauce, some fresh mozzarella, and throw a basil leaf or two on top. Ouch, that's hard to do... I can see why it's a rare commodity worth waiting long hours to have a chance to partake."" This is the strange phenomenon called ""make them wait - cause that's what makes us so special"" It may be a syndrome. And people willingly participate. Cake Boss in Hoboken has perfected this with a 2 or 3 hour wait for...cupcakes! Same thing applies there. Just use Yelp to find a bakery around the corner or up the block or maybe 3 blocks to the north, and go get some delicious cupcakes made with the same exact ingredients in the same way without waiting hours, and immediately enjoy your food - and get on with your life. Unless, of course, the experience you are looking for is... waiting. If so, enjoy the wait. Or just come back, after everyone else gets tired of ...waiting..."

Unlike many restaurants in New York that have amazing food this restaurant is perfect for those that actually want to have a conversation and have a very pleasant setting. During the course of our meal we had several courses. I opted for the duck meatballs and the duck entrée and also had the soufflé for dessert. My companion had a fish entree and we also had the cucumber side dish. The presentation was superb and the tastes were well balanced.

Waited a long time for someone to come and greet us and offer drinks. We were a party of 6 and it was an uncrowded Tuesday morning. Not sure what took them so long to come over. Over the course of our breakfast we had four different waiters. None of them communicated with each other, so we kept getting repeated questions and messed up orders. All the food came out at different times. I ordered the Eggs Florentine - served room temp at best, sitting in a pool of butter. Canned artichoke hearts. Really flavorless. Would have complained but it took them so long to bring the food, and no one checked in to see how it was, I figured it was easier to just let it go and write a Yelp review. Plus someone in our group really wanted to try the place out, and I didn't want to rain on their excitement to eat there. Everyone else's dish was also pretty poor. Luke warm, stale bread, overcooked eggs... I couldn't understand why people rave about this place. Waiter(s) forgot a side dish, brought the wrong side dish to someone else... ran into us while clearing dishes, dropped dishes next to us... it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in NY. Would definitely avoid. Love eating out in this city, have no problem paying $15 for eggs (it's NY, comes with the territory), but I want them served warm and with flavor. Don't see a reason to try it again! Would rather enjoy any number of the awesome restaurants this city has to offer!"

Having enjoyed the Astoria location immensely, we ducked around the corner of our block to check out the new local site. My date and I started with the grilled octopus. What arrived, adorned with 4 tiny pieces of marinated cucumber, were 3 very large tentacles that were a step toward justifying the $18 appetizer price. But they were one-third overcooked, meaning two of them were just right. The third? Way too dry (consistency???). The side dish was the lemon potatoes, which were fantastic. We followed that with the Greek-style shrimp Santorinh, which was excellent and beautifully spiced. We also had the pan fried Whiting - again well prepared and enjoyable. The complementary custard dessert is not only a nice touch, but heavenly. The service was very good, though at half-capacity that's not surprising. OK, so why two stars? We couldn't have a conversation! They've designed their interior to bounce noise all around, to the point where people are yelling - *yelling* - at each other across the table. And no one is drunk. Frankly, if you're going to charge Aqua Grill prices, give your clients a good experience. If I want to scream I can go to Republic Noodle, or one of the all-you-can-eat-and-drink sushi/sake-bomb bachelor party restaurants down the block and spend half the price.

Glad to live close by because I can choose to dine here on a whim whenever there's not too terrible a wait. It's one of my favorites in the Greenpoint. It's a beautiful, rustic space, and if it's nice outside, snag outdoor seating. I've dined here countless times with many different friends. Here are some highlights from the menu: Truffle fries are amazing whenever I feel like not counting the calories! Crispy and you can really taste the truffle, as well as smell it as it's approaching your table. Go ahead and indulge. Moroccan Scramble is one of my favorites for breakfast or an earlier lunch. It's a perfect combination of flavors of egg and sourdough and spice in a sausage--and avocado to top everything off! Sage Scrambled Egg Panini is my other favorite for breakfast. So simple, yet excellently executed. The spicy tomato jam is so, so good. Housemade Ricotta... do yourself a favor and order this to share. So tasty with figs and honey.. mmm! You can always ask for extra fruit-nut bread if you run out. The burgers here are also quite an experience. I think I may prefer the regular burger over the Five Leaves burger because it can be too complicated to eat (it's huge!). So I just go for the regular burger with grass-fed beef, always add bacon for $2 ;) The lamb shepherd's pie is another favorite for me. This dish use to be so big and I could never finish and would have to make it a 2 meal commitment as leftovers. But they've reduced it in size which is much more manageable (but price didn't change). However the case, it's still very delicious and comes piping hot from the oven. There are other things on the menu that are lovely too, the above are just my highlights. I've had coffee here and as takeout before, and I'm not quite a fan. I have other coffee places I prefer in the neighborhood. I just stick to alcohol with my meals haha. Hope you go, enjoy!"

One thing right away that you'll notice is that every single male employee in the building wears a big Hawaiian shirt. It's hilarious, and they just go about their day like nothing is strange about it. It certainly makes for a great dining experience. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken. The menu says that the entrees are served with white rice, but mine didn't come with it and I had to order it separately and I'm pretty sure they charged me for it. Despite that upset, the General Tso's was amazing. Served with broccoli, the chicken was hot and fresh and tasted incredible. It was certainly a decent portion and I felt very full afterwards. My advice, don't come here for a cheap Chinese food meal, and make sure they bring you your rice with your meal! Also, they don't give you free glasses of water like most restaurants; they make you buy $2 bottles of water. My meal was about $18 with tip after okay service."

Ddukbokki is okay I didn't really like it since I felt like it was also dry and I had better . Cold spicy noodle was my fav out of all the food I got . The sauce and kimchi mix together was prefect and savory, highly recommended to try. Kimchi fried rice was bland didn't really taste anything at all. Kimchi and tofu stew was so sour and salty especially the kimchi.. Now it makes me wonder if in Korea is kimchi that sour LOL . BBQ chicken was good as well but nothing special about it . They should move the line faster considering there are like 4 ppl in the cashier. Seats are limited esp when it is rush hour for lunch or dinner. Overall I might come back if I feel like getting different variety of Korean food instead of ordering in a Korean restaurant and paying a lot of $$"

We had the ""delicious"" part right.  And everything was definitely pretty.  But we were dead wrong about the ""little"" part.  Worst of all, it was all so amazing that I couldn't stop eating.  Seriously, the food was giving me some kind of disorder where I couldn't leave a crumb on the plate - troubling when the portions are as huge as they are here.  An enormous bowl of the best corn chowder I've ever had was followed by an enormous bowl of risotto and an enormous chocolate dessert.  Everything augmented, of course, by an enormous bread basket with local olive oil for dipping.   When there was finally nothing left to eat, we got up and sloshed on home to mid-Slope. I was more than a little ill for the rest of the night.    Happy birthday to me.  We'll be back, of course - just not often enough to make gluttons out of us."

Unfortunately, I was let down in so many ways, and in fact, I'm surprised any established or well-liked restaurant has the issues I experienced. I can't even comment on the food, and here's why: WE NEVER GOT IT. Arrived a little before 10 on a Saturday for brunch. The lady at the front was very welcoming, and told us to sit anywhere. The place was pretty full. After a few minutes of not being brought menus, I noticed everyone had a colorful one on their tables, so I realized we had to go pick up our own. Fine, no big deal. Until water came and our orders were taken, though, it was a good 15-20 minutes. We put our orders in and had plenty of time to watch how things were going down. For some reason there was only one waiter serving the whole restaurant - probably about 10-12 tables which were all full. Here's a sample of what we saw: condiments/salt and pepper not being brought; people served food without utensils on the table; at the same table, one of the three diners not being served with the others; at another table, a party of six that had two people waiting 15 minutes to be served while the rest of their group ate; no refills on coffee; people being served before us despite coming in after us; tables left messy with the plates/napkins/glasses of previous diners. You get the idea. Inexplicably, there was one waiter for the whole dining room. Apparently he was also meant to act as the bus boy. Occasionally the woman at the front came around to bring things, but she soon disappeared - we discovered she wound up in the back cooking. Two men - ""the cavalry"" as she called them - arrived at about 11 to ""help."" They didn't help us. Our water and coffee were never refilled. After waiting over an hour, I was getting fed up. Slow service is one thing. Nonexistent service is quite another. I was hungry already, having run in the 5K that took place in the neighborhood and finishing two hours prior. We made a decision to leave if our food didn't come within five minutes. Then, for the first time since taking our order at about 10:20 (it was now 11:10), the waiter came over and apologized but apparently our orders never made it into the system. Say no more. I told him we had to go and would just pay for the coffee. He told us how much it was, took our money, and just as we were saying we really shouldn't have to pay for the coffee, he brought the money back and said it was on them. It's really a shame because there seemed to be potential there, but under no circumstances have I ever experienced such abhorrent service. No one was incompetent per se, and the staff was friendly, but they were totally understaffed and overwhelmed. You'd think for a place that opens at 8 for breakfast and brunch, that by 10, they'd be hitting their stride. Nope, not even close. Very, very disappointing, to say the least. I won't be willing to give them a second chance. In rereading reviews from others and having had similar experiences relating to service, I'm shocked by how many people were told or wrote that the place was understaffed. Then why hasn't this changed? Makes no sense whatsoever. The best thing was we found another place on Broadway - Trufa - that was perfect. Delicious food with friendly, caring, passionate service. That's in the next review I'll write."

It's nice that this little restaurant exists in the middle of all of the nothingness that is going on in the surrounding streets. However, we did not have a good experience. The drinks are terrible but the food is good so only come here for dinner if you're ok with bad service. We were a group of 10 on a Friday night. There was 1 waitress for the entire place & though this place is tiny, she didn't do a good job at making us feel welcome. It was difficult to flag her down. Our group ordered in 3 separate waves & got our food at all different times. The food coming out 2 dishes at a time in 10 minute intervals is not ok. The drinks were so so so bad that some of us even sent them back. The chips and guac and the soft tacos were pretty good though. Interestingly, though this place closes at 2am, the waitress came by and set the bill down in the middle of our table at 12:32am, when half of us were still eating and waiting on drinks. Talk about feeling kicked out. Since we planned on having more drinks and this place doesn't close until 2am, I found this to be extremely rude. Not 1 of the 10 of us will be returning.

We had a Sunday brunch reservation for 11 AM; while two of us waited for our third to arrive, the very friendly and charming (especially for a Sunday morning) bartender made me the spiciest (and best!) Bloody Mary that I have had. My mom and friend both disliked it, deeming it too spicy, but I loved its heat. He didn't skimp on the  vodka either, as I had a pleasant buzz well into our afternoon at the Met. While the (male) bartender was cool, I wasn't a fan of the (female, tall, blonde) hostesses at the front, who seemed generally annoyed by our presence. Not that it bothered me, but I kept sensing a too-cool-for-school vibe from them. Maybe they were just hungover? At any rate, my cornmeal pancakes with caramelized bananas were pretty scrumptious. The ratio of cornmeal to flour wasn't as high as I'd have liked, making the pancakes themselves only decent, but the caramel-banana sauce is possibly the best pancake-topper I have had. However, the addition of the cinnamon-butter is too much: the sauce is so rich that any extra butter just makes it disgustingly heavy. I think it would have been better if they had simply added cinnamon to the bananas and ditched the butter. My fried also ordered the pancakes and was quite pleased. Also, the portions are very large- I was full for about 8 hours after this meal. Cookshop lost points for screwing up my mom's order (forgot to leave onions out of her scrambled eggs with smoked salmon). However, when it was finally served, it was an excellent dish. Probably the biggest drawback of this place is the icy demeanor of the hostesses, but that Bloody Mary could convince me to return and try some of their other brunch offerings on a future visit to the city."

Husband and I decided to have our Friday night dinner here and we were starving. We were seated after 10 minutes of waiting and ordered our food. It all started really nice. Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to enjoy it. A pass-by waiter dropped a large bottle full of beer right on my husband, covered him head to toe and his backpack which had a macbook it in, was also soaking wet. We got upset and the dinner was ruined. My husband was soaking wet and reeked of beer. There was broken glass everywhere, including the table and the floor. We hardly heard an apology and were causally given a few napkins. When we said that we wanted to leave, because 1 - the mood was ruined, 2 - his clothes were ruined, 3 - there was nowhere for us to sit safely and dry - the place was a mess, the waitress suggested us to ""take the food home"". Obviously they were going to give us our food for free - there wasn't even a question about it - or so we thought. We were told to wait in the hallway and few minutes later that same waitress (dyed blonde hair, didn't get her name) brought us (!!!!) - not the food, but a CHECK! A full check for everything we ordered that evening. We were shocked and shaken. We couldn't believe that after what they did they actually wanted us to PAY for it. We asked to speak to the manager. A young blonde long-haired hipster, named Andrej came out to us and said that yes, in fact we should pay for our dinner. My husband was disturbed and depressed and wanted us to leave immediately. I asked for the general manager's name and phone number and was casually given the business card of their restaurant. No apologies again, no nothing. The guy who was a hostess actually was rude and passive aggressive when we were leaving. I hope, that the person, who owns the place, sees this review.

We had a nice meal but not epic and well, a 3 star restaurant and a nearly $400 check should be epic. We had two of the best pasta dishes I've ever had - the trofeo and the spaghetti - but the rest was really lackluster. The mains: veal chop and steak were very underwhelming. Veal chop was overdone, lacked both prosciutto and sage as described in the dish. The desserts were equally unimpressive, as if the restaurant does not have a pastry chef and just another cook making run of the mill desserts. So inspired by course #2 but not by the rest leaves an overall lackluster impression. So sad not to have a better meal to report."

The crust is heavenly. The calzones are gigantic and chock-full of gooey, savory cheese. They're what other calzones ASPIRE to be. The vibe: Lucali is trendy without being pretentious. It's trendy because of what it is: a tiny neighborhood joint with only a dozen tables; that doesn't take reservations; where the regulars are families with preschoolers, fashionable couples from the Upper East Side, and of course, Jay and Bey. You can BYOB, which is friendly on your wallet, and you can call when the restaurant opens to see how long the wait is (because there will be one).

It doesn't matter if the toddlers nearby are squabbling, or if you have the table near the door - being in Lucali is tantamount to having a good night. I'm serious.

So when my friends and I settled on Cookshop for brunch, I definitely felt a wave of panic wash over me. I mean, when the website proclaims that the butcher was the original chef, one can't help but be worried. But being one to face a culinary challenge head-on, I made my way over to check it out. Outdoor seating helped to assuage my anxiety by occupying my attention as a fashionable and rather good-looking crowd walked by or joined the wait to be seated. When I could finally turn my attention to the menu, I was pleasantly surprised at my options. On the sweet side, there were the usual choices of French toast and pancakes, however, there were also more interesting treats such as sticky buns, beignets with pineapple compote, and a stuffed croissant with banana and chocolate that is out-of-this-world. To my amazement and pleasure, almost all of the egg options were also easily converted to vegetarian-friendly fare. Though the scramble with caramelized onions, crème fraiche and chives looked interesting, I opted for the poached eggs with white cheddar grits (minus the sausage). I loved the creaminess of the grits paired with the salty bite of the cheddar. And adding the mild flavor of two perfectly poached eggs was a stroke of genius. The only thing I felt missing was something with a bit more crunch - maybe next time I'll get a side of crispy toast. Other items included huevos rancheros, a frittata, skillet eggs, a hearty-looking salad, porridge and a plethora of breakfast sides (biscuits, fruit, granola, etc). If you are in Chelsea and would like to enjoy your breakfast along with a glamorous crowd without the pretention of some of the joints a few blocks south, then Cookshop is definitely worth a visit. veggiewala.com/cookshop"

He was nothing but an a**hole still.   I mean, seriously, you charge $20 for a burger, at least tell people you cook it about 2 levels less than normal, and don't be total assholes when people complain, if that's what you do. What happened to the customer is always right?   I guarantee if the manager had taken the burger to the cook and asked how he thought this burger was ordered, he would not have said medium-well....  But, we'll never know because the manager was an a*hole and just gave us the check anyway (a check for over $200 i'll add--we weren't drinking water...) The cask conditioned ale is awesome, and the appetizers we had were good too.  But their head has gotten too big about how to cook a burger, and definitely order it 2 levels more cooked then you normally would --- I can only assume if you order a well burger it will come with a layer of pink in the middle, based on how they cooked burgers ordered medium and medium-well...."

The food wasn't all that memorable, but their poor service was. I came here with my boyfriend last Friday because he had been wanting to try it based on his co-worker's recommendation. I arrived around 7:30pm and waited outside the restaurant. My bf said he wouldn't be there for another 20 minutes. Ten minutes had past and the restaurant started to fill up. I decided to grab a table while there's still one available. I walked in and there appeared to be only 1 waiter. He was taking someone's order at the time. Other workers were hidden in the kitchen, behind the small counter. No one came over to greet/seat me so I helped myself to the only empty table left. It was a table that can seat a party of 4. A waitress wearing glasses, with her hair up in a ponytail, came over and with an attitude asked how many people would be dining. I said 2 and that the 2nd person would arrive in about 10 minutes. She reluctantly allowed me to stay but moved me to another table. There was a table next to the one I sat down in. That table was a smaller table that seats 2. I didn't seat myself there because it was positioned next to a couple, who had placed their belongings on the chairs. The waitress shifted the small table slightly over so that the tables were no longer touching and instructed me to sit there instead. I sat down and the first waiter I saw brought over 2 glasses of water and the menus. I browsed through the menu and had mentally picked out what I planned to order. I started playing on my phone to pass the time. About 10 minutes had passed and that b*tchy waitress came up to me again and in a whiny voice said ""Is your friend here yet?! How much longer?!"" I turned, looked at her and said ""He'll be here any minute now"".  Sure enough my bf walked in seconds later. He had missed the entire exchange but saw that i was fuming mad. I informed him of what had happened: her attitude when she came up to me; her having me switch tables, and how she came up to me the 2nd time asking the same f*ckin' question. What she should have done was act  pleasantly and ask me something in line with ""Would you like to order something to drink?"" or ""May I start you off with some appetizers while you wait for your party?"" I was hungry so if someone were to offer to take my order, I would have began eating even before my bf showed. But no, she had to be a complete a-hole about it. My bf asked if I wanted to leave and I was very tempted to. But I decided to stay since I already sat there for so long and my bf had wanted to try their food.  A few minutes later, another female customer entered the restaurant. She was a party of 1 and guess where they sat her? That's right, they gave her that big table that seats 4. I'm surprised that b*tch didn't make her wait for a smaller table. Another young female waitress came over to take our order. I asked her who's the manager of the establishment, and sadly she gestured over to THAT lady. I told the waitress that her boss is very rude, and she just said ""sorry about that"" on her behalf. Now onto the food. We ordered the Sha Momo to share, which are fried dumplings accompanied by their hot sauce. They were okay, but no better than the dumplings that I could have ordered from my neighborhood Chinese restaurant. My bf ordered the Luksha Shamdey which was lamb with curry over rice. He's dish was good, but again not spectacular. I ordered the Gyathuk Takpa with beef, which is basically just pan fried noodles. The noodles were bland and the beef was hard, not at all tenderized. I never had to chew so much in my life and work so hard just to eat my food. When we finished the meal, the check came and it was that b*tch who came over to clear the table. While my bf paid the bill I used that opportunity to write her a note on the back of the check essentially telling her off. I will never set foot inside that poor excuse of a restaurant ever again."

I couldn't figure out quite what to say about it. It's garnered accolades from so many different directions, lowly Yelpers up on through the NY Times. Alan Richman said it was the second-best pizzeria in the U.S., for Pete's sake. So I'd love to chalk up my markedly disappointing experience there mostly to deflated expectations. Maybe if it hadn't had so much hype, I would have appreciated it more...? That's what I kept telling myself in the aftermath. After a while, I decided I shouldn't even review the place: my gut reaction to the place was so different from most that clearly something was wrong with *me* in this case. The funny thing is, despite my voraciously omnivoric tendencies, in the familiar genres I am generally pretty mainstream in my tastes. It was a weird disconnect. Because I so want to like the place. Single pizzaiolo, churning out every single pie. Rustic decor and candlelit long before the rest of gentrified Brooklyn took the aesthetic to loony extremes. Quality ingredients, applied with obvious love. But I just hated the pizza, man. I just hated it. I mean, what the F was with that crust? Char. I love me some carcinogenic char. I liked the char on the margherita pie my convive and I shared. But when the creation of char comes at the dear expense of the rest of the crust, drying it out to a cracker consistency when the sauce and cheese are not designed for such a dessicated bed... Then it is a soul error against pizza.  Sure, the cheese: good. Nicely flavored sauce. Impeccably fresh basil. All of it slid off the bedding like water off a duck. A bone-dry, reconstituted sawdust kind of duck. I'm used to slippery toppings at the hyper-Neapolitan joints around town, where it seems a necessary evil (as if the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana wants to make damn sure you'll need a fork for their specimens). But at a place where you can pick up the slice without sag (BECAUSE HOW COULD SUCH BRITTLE ARIDITY EVER SAG?), this skittery topping business should be a non-issue. Okay. Breathe. Stop criticizing. Concentrate on the positive. The calzone was pretty good. Not Keste or anything in that department, but solid. And it really is some beautiful decor for a pizzeria. It's nice to have that communal feeling with other food lovers whilst braving the long wait. And it's BYOB. So ignore this review. Go. Pity me but abandon me all the same in my Donatella-Paulie Gee-Zero Otto Nove-Franny's ghetto. I'll welcome you to it if it comes to that, don't worry. Probability of return within 1 year: 0%"

I reluctantly agreed to get #8 (the grilled pork), which also looked pretty good. The prices have gone up ($5 now), but I found to my immense pleasure that it is still totally worth it. We started with the grilled pork, which was surprisingly delicious, albeit in a very different way. I was startled by the distinct hint of lemongrass, and the meat was quite reminiscent of the grilled pork that comes with vermicelli. It was tasty, but I was continually startled by the lemongrass flavor (nope, somehow didn't acclimate to it) and eagerly awaiting my half of the #1 (which I couldn't even finish, tragically, because I can eat at most 3/4 of a banh mi). The avocado shake was everything that I thought an avocado shake should be - not powdery and artificial-tasting, but not tasting solely like avocadoes through a blender. I didn't catch what she did - I assume she added sugar - but it was smooth, delicious and refreshing. I would definitely get it again.

The service here is incredibly slow and not because a kati roll takes time to make. It's slow because the workers meander and slosh around like time isn't precious or something. Here are two examples: 1. I ordered two chicken kati rolls. Said kati rolls took over 20 minutes to make since there was a fairly large order in front of me. I was fine with that, but then it took 10 more minutes to actually be placed in the plastic bags and handed to me. The cashier was just taking more orders, completely ignoring my freshly made rolls sitting on the counter behind him. Then he decides to walk around to the back to perform some side-jobs or something. The guy making the kati roll doesn't really care, since apparently he has tunnel vision on just making the rolls and doesn't see the ones he made have been sitting there for a while. 2. I went there at 4PM on a Sunday. I ordered a Unda Chicken and Shrimp Masala roll. The roll maker decides he wants to sweep the floor first before making my roll (all the while my egg and meats were done sitting there).  Then he decides to bs a little with the other guys before finally putting on gloves (didn't wash his hands, which was a bit scary) and making my roll. I was literally the only person waiting for food. Why couldn't they just make my roll first? Was there some obstacle, some Kati Roll Run that I'm unaware of on the floor that they had to clear? Perplexing. Little things like these bother me. It shows they don't care enough of their patron's time when they could clearly be more efficient.

There are far too many pizza options to settle for this over priced hype. I am happy to pay the extra cost for organic ingredients and to support local venues, this one can do  A LOT better."

I went here on a moderately busy Thursday night. Great food, friendly but slow service. My fiance and I decided to go ""Tapas- style"" by ordering six small plates instead of any entrees. We ordered the Calamari and Scallop salad, Maple Peach BBQ Pork, Cajun Crab Cakes, Cafe Frise salad, and two specials: Cajun Beef Chili, and Lobster Cakes. Decor and ambiance certainly payed respect to New Orleans- beads, masks, and vintage lighting and mirrors were everywhere, as well as various international movie posters for A Streetcar Named Desire. It was fitting. I'll start with the weaker points: we didn't like the Maple Peach BBQ pork. It was too much of the sweet maple peach, and not enough of the BBQ kick I was expecting. This is a personal preference, though. Overall I thought the meat was cooked well, just too sweet. And, on a side note, I found that some of the sweetness that I initially found overwhelming actually diminished overnight. I ate the leftovers cold today and thought it tasted way better. The Cafe Frise salad was also just a little off to me. It could have used a little more dressing, or perhaps just a little more flavor in the dressing. It just needed something... I ended up dipping the bites of salad into the leftover sauce from the Lobster cakes and it helped a lot. Everything else we loved. I'm from Maryland, so I have high expectations for crab cakes but am not too proud to acknowledge that there are other regional recipes out there. These crab cakes were fantastic- like MD crab cakes with a creole kick! Cooked perfectly with just enough crunch and just enough softness and moisture. The lobster cakes were also perfect. Simply delicious. The Cajun chili was a steak and kidney bean chili topped with a bit of sour cream. What can I say? Hit the spot. We both loved it! Last but not least is our absolute favorite of the night- the Calamari and Scallop salad. Served in an avocado shell, the presentation was delightful. More important than that however, the taste and the texture of the three elements mixed together! It would have never dawned on me to try them together at home but it really, really works! Best dish of the night! Like I said, the service was on the slow side. It wasn't too busy and there were two servers and a bar tender. It wasn't too bad, but then again I'm a fairly patient person. I still don't think it shouldn't have taken as long as it did to get the waitress's attention to ask for a refill or ask for a check. Which reminds me, fountain soda refills ARE NOT free like in most places. If you have two glasses of coke, you're paying for 2 glasses of coke. Just saying..."

(1) The restaurant ::: The place is in a small, well decorated, and intimate space. We were greeted at the door by the owner, whose name is George, who lead us to the bar where we got a couple free samples of wine while we waited. I told the owner that we lived in the neighborhood and that we were happy to try his restaurant for the first time (** this is important, remember this for later). They have a good selection of Argentinean Malbecs, so I took my time in pretending I was knowledgeable about wines and to find the 2nd cheapest one to order. We also got two cocktails, which were excellent and relatively similar in style and quality to what you would expect from a place in this price range. (2) The food ::: The menu had many enticing appetizers including the empanadas and grilled octopus. We got both, and they were fine. I mean, I can get empanadas from a NYC street cart for $1 and they'd be about the same, but these were only $3 each I think. The real star of the show was the rib-eye steak. The rib-eye cut was extra fatty and juicy, just the way I like it.  At $22, this rib-eye is priced very well compared to other places, and in my opinion, this place cooked it better. The juices were the precisely level of savoriness to go well with the scalloped potatoes from a different dish (ironically, the rib-eye did not come with potatoes, but rather with a weird 3 bean salad). (3) The mandatory tip attempt and the owner's Mea Culpa :::  Before we get to the rip-off attempt, let's talk about the waitress. She was a seemingly nice young lady, but she was pushy. She was assertive in what she recommended, and if you didn't agree with her, she showed clear visual signs of disappointment. This puts pressure on you while you're ordering because if you're on a budget, you may not want to order an appetizer per person, that 2nd or 3rd cocktail, or that dessert at the end of the meal. For me, it was fine. I get it, it's a small business, they're trying their hardest to prosper and since we were willing to order wine and cocktails at the beginning of the meal, they thought that we'd be cool with more. Ok, so now for the coup de grace: When the bill came from the waitress, there was no itemized receipt, but rather, just a total, which was c. $136 for 2 people before the ""Tip"" line. It was a little surprising to me because when I did the math in my head, we only ordered about $90-95 worth of stuff for two people before tax/tip, so it should have been around $101 before the ""Tip"" line compared with the actual $136 check we got. I made a strange facial expression when I saw the check, and the owner apparently saw it. Overall, I didn't mind the $136 bill because, I was out on a date, I don't want to blow it by making a big deal out of the bill, and after all the food was good. But then minutes later, the owner came by on his own, apologized to me, saying that he had given me the wrong bill. Then he gave me a corrected bill, but this time, it was itemized. I remember the precise amount of the ""wrong bill"" and did the math, which worked out to precisely 35.00% tip (coincidence? Whatever. No big deal). It seems that they had tried to give themselves a 35.00% tip on their own and tried to hide it. The owner probably remembered that we lived in the neighborhood, we were first-time customers, and we had a high likelihood of returning if we enjoyed our experience. In the end, I wrote in a voluntary tip amount that was exactly the 35.00% they had written in for themselves, because if they wanted it that badly, it's fine with me. Overall, the restaurant is nice, the food is well priced and very high quality for the price. Certain aspects of the service was questionable, as discussed above, but listen, I know how hard it is to be a small business owner. I get it and I wish them the best, but I found it strange that this had to happen. I would have given the restaurant a 3.0 (as opposed to a 2.5) on ""Quality of the Experience"" had this mandatory tip attempt. My experience will likely not happen to you, so I would still recommend trying this restaurant."

It's okay to not be Italian if you are serving, but seriously, at least learn your menu, and accommodate your customer. We asked for a large soup, so that we could share, the very dismissive Ecuadorian server quickly told us no, it cannot be shared, and that the soups are only served in one large bowl. Little does he know that pasta faccioli soup can indeed be shared, and it's best served in a smaller bowl. While we waited for our food, after 50 minutes it arrives, only to see that fettuccine alla bolognese, was served in a medium dark brown sauce and not the traditional red. The meat was undercooked and the taste of this plate was simply gross. It was almost like seeing one of those most unrepresentable beef stroganoff that you can buy in a box at your nearest super market.

The space itself is packed and a bit on the noisy side. Total bill for my meal came out to ~$60 for the duck and wine. I'm not sure if I just didn't order the ""right"" thing, but price/quality ratio here just didn't do it for me. I hear their brunch menu has some great options, though, so you might want to consider checking it out for Sunday brunch instead."

I had the falafel plate, which came with a number of small falafel balls, perfectly flavored and absolutely delicious. In addition, there were two small pockets of warm pita, great veggie salad, some rather bland hummus, and two dipping sauces (the mango sauce tasted a little bitter but the green sauce was delicious!). Overall, the falafel was really good and all the other components were enjoyable. I would order again. My friend got a spinach and goat cheese omelet which looked fabulous.

My date was not impressed.  He left most of it on his plate.   And by comparison to their lunch specials the dinner price was high (around $20 instead of $12 or so)   The waiter was pushing us to pay and sign the tab while we began eating.   I tipped him over twenty percent nonetheless.  Far more than he deserved given his overt rudeness.

It's huge, rustic and seemingly very popular with the young and the beautiful, the well-heeled and the well-traveled (read: tourists). There are daily specials but I'm preferential to the Balthazar bar steak, which is essentially steak-frites served with a bearnaise. Ordered medium-rare, it comes out nearly perfect with a slight char on the exterior. The french fries are pretty standard, which is to say, great. My friend ordered the duck confit, which came out crispy and well seasoned, although a little dry. His escargots were better in my opinion, simple and served in a very garlicky butter. A cote du rhone suggested by our waiter paired nicely with the meal and was reasonably priced at just over $30. Ultimately the food and the experience at Balthazar is everything that it should be in a bistro/brasserie: solid and reliable. The caveat is that nearly everything is also a little pricier than it probably should be. The service, however, is impeccable, which is made more impressive by the cramped, packed-in layout of the dining area that ensures everyone gets jostled at least a dozen times during their meal. The wine list is a sizeable selection from France (of course) with an emphasis on Bordeaux."

So, last friday i finally got a chance to experience Lucali for myself. Since they do not take reservations, we got there early, thinking there would be less of a wait. The place has no sign out front, just an awning with big windows. Walking up to the place I immediately got a waft of garlic. It made my hungry tummy grumble wishing i could just go in and eat. The hostess took my name and number saying she would call when our table was ready, in about 45 min. I thought that was pretty cool, because then we didn't have to wait right in front of the place. We walked down the street to go buy some wine. A few blocks down we walked into a cute little wine shop and asked the gentleman behind the counter for a recommendation, he knew we were going to Lucali. He suggested a modestly priced bottle ($11) of montelpuciano, an italian red.   We walked back to the restaurant and waited out front. When she finally called my name, we excitedly walked in to our adorable rustic table. The first thing i heard from the table behind me was ""Sooo Vinny cawled me...."" The whole back of the place is the kitchen area, and you can watch the handsome men in their cute white tees making pies, rolling out the dough with emptied wine bottles. The whole place is very dim lighting, but not too dim, very romantic. We ordered a pie with artichoke and a calzone with red peppers and pepperoni. The pie came out super fast, and was deeeee-licous. I wouldn't say the best pizza i've ever had, but definitely  in the top 5. Between the three of us we scarfed it down, not even looking up to talk to each other, within minutes. Then came the calzone. Make sure to ask for sauce on the side if you want it. The calzone was yummy. I'm usually not a big fan of pepperoni, but this pepperoni was delicious and had a little spiciness to it. Although, next time i won't get the red peppers, they are so finely chopped, i could barely taste them. Then, we ordered another pie. This time with garlic. Which made me realize that the first pie would have been better with garlic. I left the restaurant entirely happy, and a little buzzed. I would definitely recommend this place for a date or just even if you want a good slice of pie. They only serve two things on the menu, pizza and calzones, so that makes it really easy :) The only reason i gave the place 4 stars instead of 5 was because our water glasses could have been filled a little more frequently, and it's a little expensive. Pies are $24 and calzones are either $10 or $20. Dinner for 3 was $85 before tip (for 2 pies and 2 calzones)."

The way the food was presented made the experience much more enjoyable. A small mortar with sesame seeds is provided to mix with the katsu sauce. It seems pretentious at first, but it really adds a lot of flavor to the sauce. The pickles are really good and matches well with the meal. I really enjoyed the katsu, because it was well seasoned and deep-fried perfectly. The only thing that somewhat bothered me was that compared to the actual meat portion, there seemed to be a lot of fat.

Arrived a little before 7:30 and the bar was busy but there were still plenty of seats available at the bar. But within 20-30 minutes, the bar was packed and people were waiting for seats. The bartenders were good about keeping guests apprised of seat availability and making sure that you were taken care of while you waited. Started with the escargot appetizer ($14). Very plump and sizable, but the flavor was only so-so. Nothing was particularly memorable about it. My previous two experiences - first time in France and second time on a cruise - yielded better memories. Enjoyed the Saturday night special - beef short ribs ($32), which came with a side of creamy mashed potatoes and a few vegetables. The short ribs were incredibly tender and fell off the bone easily. The flavoring was good and the mashed potatoes were really creamy. For dessert, I couldn't decide what I wanted so I ordered two - 1) the pineapple upside down cake with coconut ice cream and pina anglaise and ($9) 2) creme brulee ($9). I mean, I couldn't go to a French restaurant and NOT order creme brulee, now could I?! Sad to report that the creme brulee was rather disappointing. The consistency  and size for the value was good, but there was something off about the flavor. It just wasn't sweet enough, maybe? On the flip side, the pineapple upside down cake was fabulous. The warm cake was a perfect balance to the cold coconut ice cream. It was really a perfect dessert. I gobbled ever last bit of it. Overall, I would say that I enjoyed my experience at Balthazar. The food was good, but not fantastic (pineapple upside down cake aside). I would probably return here to try their steak frites (which from the reviews seems like the thing to get, but I'm a sucker for short ribs)."

Coffee refills happened before we ever had to ask. Everyone else has covered the oohs & ahhs around the food, so I'll just leave 3 quick tips: (1) For your sanity, absolutely make reservations not matter which meal; (2) Les huîtres selection: opt for east coast ones only, save your west coast cravings for when you're on the west coast (logical, huh?); (3) Tables are very close together, so if you're even a little claustrophobic, dine only during non-peak hours. 10pm dinner on Sunday night was magical!

The worst thing about Scratcher is that, at first glance, it seems like a fine place. The music is alright (if you can stand them playing the same Radiohead album over and over again every Thursday night) and the ambiance is tolerable. It looks like any darkened date bar. Then you meet the bartenders. The woman bartender, who is perpetually strung out, and her angry Irish counterpart. When they are actually behind the bar- which isn't often mind you- they provide mostly the worst service you could possibly expect from a bar. If you ask for a PBR (which they run out of at about nine PM every night) they glare at you like you just punched their mom in the face before lazily opening the can and handing it to you. If you don't tip them for every single drink they call you out on it. Not a polite ""Is there something wrong with my service?"" No. That would be too nice for an employee of Scratcher. They just say: ""Where's my tip, you bitch?"" So, basically, what you have to remember at Scratcher is that drinks are actually a dollar more expensive than they are on the menu. Well, more expensive if you don't want to be yelled at by their staff. Example: Last night a group of friends and I were waiting at the bar for drinks. We'd been waiting for some time so I rose my hand to flag her down. She stopped in the middle of what she was doing to tell me that I was a bitch and that she wouldn't serve me. So, I'm a bitch for flagging down a bartender for drinks. Wonderful. This is just what I wanted from my night out. This was after I tipped her all night too. Scratcher is the worst possible bar in the East Village. If you want to go somewhere to get insulted for expecting good service- then it is the place for you. If not, try one of the other 800 bars in the East Village. Other bars which are cheaper than the overpriced Scratcher. Every time I come back with friends (who inexplicably like this place) I think it will be different- that, perhaps this time, I won't be showered with profanity for expecting decent service from a sober bartender. I guess that's just too much to expect from Scratcher."

I really wanted to try the half jerk chicken which is reasonably priced at $9, but they had ran out for the night and not gonna lie, I was disappointed but I decided to get the curry goat. Wow is all I can really say. I've had curry goat at a few places in Crown Heights and this is by far the best. At other places, the meat was still either too tough (it's one of those things that takes VERY long to cook) or the dish was full of bones. This dish at Glady's was super melt in your mouth tender and didn't have many bones. Usually comes with a side of white rice, but they were low and gave me rice and peas, which was a welcome addition. Also had a tropical cocktail which was pretty strong.

By ""good"" I *don't* mean breaded deep fried cardboard who's only flavor is of the month old oil used to fry it. I mean the kind of cutlet that's tender, juicy and flavorful on the inside and delicately breaded and crisply fried on the outside. Katsuhama is one of the few places this side of the Pacific that I've had the pleasure to indulge in such a perfect piece of deep fried pork. They may claim it's their special blend of oil they change daily, or their house made bread crumbs (all of which help), but really it comes down to the quality of the meat. You see, over the years pork has been bred to be leaner and leaner (read: healthier). Unfortunately, this has also left modern pigs dry, tough and rather tasteless. Gone are the days of a well marbled tenderloin... Or are they?... Katsuhama's source for pork must have had found some heirloom livestock poking around in the far reaches of its pens because this meat is phenomenal! Pay the extra few bucks to get the tenderloin and you'll be rewarded with each bite as the crisp breading crumbles away and the meat explodes in a burst of flavor and juice (no, not in a Pop Rocks kind-of-way). I've been here twice and both the Curry Katsu (Tonkatsu enrobed in Japanese curry sauce), and the Oroshi Katsu (Tonkatsu covered in grated daikon radish and served with a citrus/soy dipping sauce) were exquisite. And now, the catch... The interior looks a bit like a char grilled hotdog with Dijon mustard with its pale pink, black and curry yellow walls. Worse yet, the service was rushed, and while not horrible, it was robotic and made someone who could usually care less about service feel mildly uncomfortable. That said, if you're used to eating in Chinatown, this is really no different and the Tonkatsu more than makes up for its service related shortcomings. Being in East Midtown it's not the most convenient place for me to get to, but when I'm in the mood for great Tonkatsu, I find myself making the trek without a second thought."

From the moment we sat down, we had an excellent server tell us about the various specials that evening and helped us choose the perfect wine suited to our tastes and mood. We opted for the seafood platter, and a delicious cheese appetizer - which the server recommended. For the two of us, I was shocked at the size and quality of our seafood. We had the freshest oysters, clams, mussels, prawns and more - with delicious dipping sauces and a side of frites. We couldn't even finish all the food, and this is quite rare when you dine out in NYC! As one of the last people in the restaurant, we had the pumpkin dessert and there was no indication form the wait staff that we should start ""leaving"" - although it was clear everyone was packing up and getting ready to go home.

I said we did not have reservations. The restaurant was 80% empty. There were probably 3 tables that had guests dining. The host had the nerve to tell us they could not accommodate us and he had to check but he might have had a seat at the bar because it gets pretty busy on weekends. My girlfriend and I looked at each other and walked out. How can an empty restaurant refuse service. We walked by a half hour later and the restaurant was still dead.

Started with a cognac/chartreuse based cocktail at the bar, which was truly delightful on that warm day. Order the Salade Lyonnaisse which was perfectly assembled, dressed and top with a poached egg that had to be dropped into swirling water, perfect texture and temp, nothing like this salad which you toss the egg into the salad. Lardons where lardons! Most say Caesar I say Lyonnaisse! It's so good to go to a French restaurant that serves amazing French wines from all areas and at all price points. I wish I was there with my wife or a friend, because the Half Bottle list is small but exceptional. Then on to the Bar Steak Frites, ordered a glass of Chinon and asked the bartender for a bit of sea salt which brought the whole plate together, (sorry Mayor Bloomberg), the skirt steak is harder to cut than a NY, but it melted in my mouth! The frites, well I had to stop myself from ordering another order . . . the barman served a lesser cru of Bordeaux which too was quite good to wash the steak and frites down with.

I came here awhile back and was extremely pleased with my first dining experience here. Where can you possibly find good French food that's BYOB in NYC? That was one of their major strong points. However, I came here with a few girlfriends the other night with several bottles of wine only to find out that it would cost us $20 per bottle...what a huge disappointment! As for the service, I feel like the current staff isn't friendly at all. There was only one table besides us in the whole restaurant at 6:30pm. The waiter was extremely rude to us when explaining the corkage fee. Also, throughout the meal there were no courtesy check-ins even though they walked by and looked at us several times. We were quite upset but the staff didn't seem to care. As for the food, I've tried: ESCARGOT--Roasted with butter, pesto and garlic sauce. This was very aromatic and flavorful. GOAT CHEESE TART--The goat cheese was on the heavier side. It tasted as if I was biting into a whole stick of cheese. Wished it had a better texture and was more balanced perhaps with a little less goat cheese and a crunchier tart. MUSSELS--Cooked in white wine & fresh herbs. Use the complimentary bread to soak up the left over sauce! I would skip on this appetizer since I found it more on the bland side. DUCK BREAST--Perfectly seared in a red wine sauce. This was really good all around. The sauce paired really well with the savory meat. FILET MIGNON--My medium-rare filet mignon was topped off with foie gras. The foie gras literally melted in my mouth, it was so good! The steak itself was juicy and tender, basically just cooked to perfection. The dish came with a side of red wine truffle sauce which was super savory when combined with the foie gras & the meat. This tasted absolutely amazing and was the highlight of my meal. Well executed dish, highly recommended! BANANA CREME BRULEE--Crispy, tasty, and filled with its sweet banana flavor. Great choice! Overall, great cozy French bistro with a dim/relaxed atmosphere.

Just when you thought that all the US had to offer gastronomy was the cheeseburger and hot dog you discover this gem on Union Street off 6th Ave in Brooklyn. To define the dinner experience as ""pleasant"" or even ""delicious"" is a gross understatement to the sheer spectacle on the palate that the dishes accomplish. I went with a friend who is a very finicky eater and I have only heard of the restaurant. I've passed by on previous occasions but have always found the tight quarters to be filled to capacity with a line waiting. This time, I made a reservation and the service was overwhelmingly polite which is sort of discomforting for a native New Yorker. From the moment we walked in for a 6pm reservation the attention didn't stop. There was constant water refills, regular check ups from the waitress and even --and this really impressed me-- we were offered a table in the outdoor portion when a noisy baby made his wailing appearance for dinner. We politely declined and enjoyed the bread and oil. This is not your typical restaurant. It is a narrow establishment on a corner but it is well lit and cozy. Cozy is not to be confused with cramped. I noticed that the wait staff took extra pains to ensure that customers were not elbowing each other and there was still ample room between tables and chairs to allow clearance for the wait staff to pass. Do not commit the same mistake I did and appear in jeans and sneakers. Although no one appeared to notice, I did feel a little out of place since everyone else was in slacks and shoes. Don't expect a Coke or a Corona either. They only serve very froufrou drinks and a lengthy selection of wine. I was very charmed by the hostess who went through great lengths at demonstrating her hospitality. I've read previous reviews and it appears this may have been an effort on her part to redeem her reputation (or that of her predecessor). Hospitality is a mild description but it was very Non-New York, which is fine. As a matter of fact it was refreshing. Our waitress was very nice and more mild mannered. She brought us the wooden menus and noted that all their dishes changed seasonally and all their ingredients were grown in local organic farms. Kudos to Rose Water for jumping on the organic bandwagon. The meal was sensational, in the truest definition of the word: it appealed to all the senses. I had the baked polenta. OMG I was savoring every bite. It was a complex layering of flavors and textures that created an exquisite perichoresis of a flavor profile. When the waitress approached the table with the dish I was left a bit puzzled. The image was not what I expected the polenta to look like. I had to reassess my understanding of what polenta should be. The waitress explained to me that the chef reduces it to an extreme and out comes a succulent cake that begins as savory on the tongue, evolves to sweet and ends with a salty kick. While you bit there is a crunch then a soft warm center and finally a sweet sauce to enhance the natural sugars. I detected so many herbs that I was overwhelmed but the slow release of flavors made the brain approach a near hallucinogenic state.  I didn't want the polenta to end. I took small modest bites and allowed my mouth to have an explosion of joyful yummyness. The pumpkin soup was a wonderful starter. It is a pureed pumpkin with creme fraiche and it was good. It had a mild cinnamon taste to it and the creme fraiche added an enhancement to the texture of the soup. My experience with anything made with pumpkin is that it is gloppy, and gelatinous but this was smooth, creamy and reminded me of the texture of whipped cream. This is not your mother's thanksgiving pumpkin soup. It's a very hoity-toity home style dish. Dessert was good, not great, just good. I had the apple fritters and it was delicious. Honestly, it didn't measure up to the rest of the meal but that's alright, you can't expect exponential greatness across three courses. American food has a reputation of being fattening, unoriginal, prepackaged and flavorless. We are known for putting a sauce, salt or cheese on anything and everything and then microwaving it. If Rose Water is the New American fare that everyone is talking about then thank God. It makes sense, after all every dish I ate there was like the 4th of July in my mouth. Explosively good."

As such we come here frequently and have always had great food, drinks and service. However, I wanted to write as I recently had a very annoying experience. We popped in around 6pm on Memorial Day weekend with the intention of just having a quick drink at the bar. All the bar seats were taken and so I asked if we could sit at one of the other tables explaining we would only be there for 1 drink (there were about 10 free dining tables at this point) I was told no, they were only for dining, so as a last resort I asked if we could just stand at the bar. Again I was told no, there is no room, which quite frankly was ridiculous. The maître de who I was speaking with was new and not the usual girl, I felt she was very rude and unaccommodating, speaking down to us like we weren't good enough for her establishment. A great shame as we usually have a wonderful time here."

We came all the way from Manhattan to Brooklyn to try my friend's favorite brunch spot here and it was AMAZING! It was Monday mid day and surprisingly people are already waiting in line to eat here. We were given an hour wait and ended up sipping some bloody mary next door. The hostess was nice enough to came by when the table was ready. Not so much of a sweets in the morning type of person, I skipped the Ricotta Pancakes and went with the Big Breakfast with Steak. It was AWESOME! I rarely eat scrambled eggs, but after seeing some of the scrambled eggs they served, I realized I must have some. It was soft, lightly cooked, fluffy buttery deliciousness paired with mushrooms, hash brown cakes and perfectly done rare steak. Even when I go to nice steakhouses people tend to overcook rare steak, but here at Five Leaves, they cook their steak PERFECTLY. For a small additional charge (i think $4?) you get a 6oz steak, isn't that a good deal?! Service was great. Bloody Mary was tasty. I couldn't think of anything else that could make this breakfast better than it already was."

You could easily pass by their front due to its desolate and somewhat dingy location on 10th. However, once you open their door and walk through, the first observation is, ""Wow, it's really tiny in here,"" followed by ""and incredibly cozy and comfortable."" I sat at the bar, as I usually do, and ordered the MACANUDO (Gin, St. Germain, pear and clove syrup, egg white, and fresh lime juice, finished with mint and black pepper). I though t it was Meh... The flavors felt a bit watered down and just flat. All of the ingredients are my favorite so I thought it would be an easy like... not so much. For the hunger, I ordered the PÂTÉ CON MERMELADAS DE UVAS BLANCAS as well as the TUNA TARTARE (Special). At first bite, I enjoyed the Tuna Tartare in its avocado and micro green combination. I feel that it could have used some better seasoning due to its taste being a bit bland., but it was nice to be eating it. It was all over when I bit into the PATE! One bite is smooth, luscious, and perfectly coating. The flavor was perfectly rich. My favorite part about this 'treat' was its grape jelly; it was a necessary element to the dish and added a counter of sweet, fruity, zest to cut through the fatty, liver. After ordering more bread (with these types of dishes, you ALWAYS have to ask for more toasted bread, am I right?), I decided to add on to the snacking with an order of the brie and blue cheeses, nuts, and prosciutto. Oh course, this was an easily made smile and positive note for Porteno. Again, the grape preserve that came with the 'dish' helped cut through the salts and fats of the prosciutto and cheese. As far as service went, eh! I just don't know. I had come in on a very early, quiet day where I think the staff was just beginning and seemed to be inspecting the new wines for the eve--all a part of the expected. However, when I asked about some of the wines and some details about food pairing there was an immediate tone of ""I don't know but everything (of course) is awesome"" Not usually a great sign... Fine by me, I just didn't ask any more questions. _________________ OVERALL SUMMARY: I recommend PORTENO for casual snacking and drinking. It's a perfect place to 'hang' and unwind with very little involvement from the staff (which can be a very nice thing). However, if you are looking for an establishment with knowledgable recommendations/etc, I wouldn't recommend this as a first option. I will definitely be coming back to make further judgements on items that are actually cooked, rather than assembled."

We had a reservation for a friends birthday at 9:30, they close at 11:30 on  Saturdays so we figured no problem. When we got there the waitress in the front was a little abrupt but no big deal, she passed us off to someone else got us seated fine. Once we were seated out waitress asked us quite quickly if we were ready to order. I asked her for a few minutes, we hadn't had a chance to review the menu yet. She said no problem, came back about a minute later, I said we still weren't quite there (we hadn't had a chance to really take a look it was so quick) I asked her for another ""90 seconds"" she said fine, walked away, and it was literally the last time we saw her for the night. After waiting ten minutes for her to return we were a little confused, then I looked up and saw her grab a to-go bad and her purse and walk out the door. Her shift had ended and she literally walked out the door without giving us an update, introducing us to our new waitress, whatever. A few minutes later (it was a LONG wait altogether, we drained our drinks in the process) a new waitress showed up. She made no explanation for the change (she didn't know we had seen the first waitress leave) and just said ""do you know what you want yet). We ordered some appetizers (meatballs, goat cheese and fried cauliflower, which were all beyond delicious) and our meals all at once for fear that we wouldn't see her again. The food came out (not delivered by her) and was great. Between us all we tried shawarma, schnitzel and couscous and it was all perfectly prepared and so good. Out water glasses remained empty for a majority of the meal and we had to ask random employees to refresh our drinks. Finally, as we were celebrating a friends birthday we wanted dessert. She came to clear our table asking only ""you done"" to which we said yes, but would like to see a dessert menu. She walked away without a word and brought us THE CHECK instead! Ok fine. (Mind you, it was 11 o'clock now, half an hour from closing, there were plenty of other people in the place, and it wouldn't have been so late in the first place if the service was at all decent). We decided just to cut our losses and pay since we weren't feeling very welcome. We put our check out to be collected and then we waited. We looked around to see where our waitress had gone and noticed that they were having a staff meal in the restaurant (I actually think this is sweet. .. but you still have to you know. . . do your job). I tried to make eye contact, no avail. We waited some more. One of my friends got annoyed and stood up to go confront her because we had waited so long. . . I talked her out of it (maybe I shouldn't have) we waited some more. Finally she takes the check.  Brings it back promptly. On the way out she mutters ""later"" under her breath. . .not good bye, not have a good evening ""later"".  It's not a cheap place, and the atmosphere, which is lovely, doesn't lend itself to such crappy service.

I feel like I'm slowly trying my way through all the Momofuku restaurants. I definitely love this one way more than Noodle Bar, and that's say a lot because I love Noodle Bar! First of all, stop complaining about the price! This is New York City, this is David Cheng, and this is AMAZING FOOD. When I first read all the Yelp reviews, I was ready to pay an arm and a leg when I came here. Then I saw the menu and realized the majority of Yelpers don't understand what with great quality comes great cost. So stop raving about how the food is amazing but it's ""too"" expensive. You get what you pay for, and personally, I think you get more than what you pay for here. Food here is just like at Noodle Bar, on the slightly less flavorful for me side, but for some reason it works here. Ordered the Steamed Buns, which are the same as the ones at Noodle Bar. Still not my favorite, but I still loved it. Then we had the Fried Brussel Sprouts, and let me tell you, I don't even like Brussel Sprouts that much and I was fighting everyone for the last few bites. The only reason not to order this dish is if you're allergic to Brussel Sprouts. And then we decided to go with the Boneless Whole Ssam Fish, because it's been too long since I've had a whole fish. I don't even care if whole fishes gross you out, this is a must have! One of the more expensive dishes, but it's a whole fish, and you don't have to pick through bones! Came with flour tortillas and butter lettuce and a creme fraiche, and somehow it turned into one of the most delicious fish ""taco"" wraps ever. My group picked that fish clean. Then we got the Pork Sausage and Rice Cakes, and let me tell you it was both heaven and hell in my mouth. Very spicy, though nobody else at my table thought so, which means I'm just a big baby when it comes to spicy foods. Even still, I suffered through the burning tongue because this is the best pork sausage and rice cake ever! Love that there's a slight crisp to the rice cake. Table next to us ordered the Age Dried Steak, or something, and it looked amazing. Market price so I suspect that it's expensive, but HUGE portion. Definitely will think about trying that next. Service was great, nothing special but my water was always filled. Waiter was very helpful in explaining all the dishes to us and making suggestions, so we pretty much went with his suggestions.

I'm not a big Raisin fan but i think it adds just the right amount of acidity so its not overwhelmingly sweet.

It's hard to pick starters when you want to save room for those exceptional entrees. A friend and I managed to share Veal meatballs and the Grilled Squid. The squid was tender, but nothing too special about it. Also, it was def. not meant for sharing.

I recently went here for a friend's birthday party and we had the dining area in the back. Loved the decor--it's very quaint and cozy. The food is also delicious. We had most of the appetizers. The ""dumplings"" are very good, although they resemble potstickers more than their bulbous counterpart dumplings. I'd say the dumpling meat was on the sweet side--definitely a contrast to the salty and savory dumplings you'd find at, say, Eton in Carroll Garden. Still very good. I thought the crab cake appetizer was prepared very well with a delicately crispy coasting and fresh, sweet crab meat inside. Their sauteed sweetbread was good (yummy, thymus glands!!), but not mind blowing. And their panko-crusted prawns (like breaded shrimp) was not overwhelmingly heavy; surprisingly light. For my entree, I had the red snapper which was superb! I ate the entire thing and the portion was on the big side (it was oddly bigger than the chicken entree my boyfriend ordered). The snapper, which was juicy and not overcooked at all, came with grilled cauliflower and mizuna (which is ""similar to/like baby arugula"") in a hazelnut-truffle sauce. Doesn't that sound delicious? It was! I loved the sweetness of the caramelized cauliflower against the fish and the bitter, herby mizuna. The roast chicken entree was alright--it's difficult to fancy up roast chicken but I thought The Good Fork make a valiant effort. The braised leeks, mash and ""black bean sauce"" (if you could call it that) failed to all come together for a memorable dish however. The portion was also surprisingly small. I also tried some of the risotto which is VERY good. And I also ate someone's leftover linguine carbonara (what a glutton, right?). While I thought the pasta itself was good (which seemed more like a ribbony egg noodle than linguine), the carbonara sauce w/ bacon, arugula, sage and parmigiano failed to impress me. And I LOVE spaghetti carbonara. Out of all the dishes I tried that night, I failed to see how the food could be considered French-Korean fusion. The place did have a very good variety of foods and flavors however. My boyfriend promised me he'd bring me back so I can try the ""steak & eggs"" Korean style (aka the grilled skirt steak, fried eggs and kimchi fried rice entree), but it might be a while before I can get my taste buds on that. Red Hook is a little off the beaten path for us, but I'll be sure to visit The Good Fork again next time I'm in the 'hood. Also, their service is wonderful! It's a great place to have a small birthday dinner/gathering if you're in the area."

They do it up right. The restaurant is small and sparse. We arrived as a party of three at opening time and were seated directly. We popped the cork on one of three BYOB white wines which were conveniently picked up in a fine wine shop a few doors down. The server announced the minimal menu and we placed our order which would not fit on the table if brought out at once. The waitress modified our order to arrive in stages so as not to overcrowd the table. Quick thinking saved the day. Now to the food. The pizza came out quickly and was perfectly done, nice crispy crust, delicious cheeses and very fragrant and tasty basil. The calzone was huge and like the pizza perfectly done. It was served with a plain sauce and some grated cheese. The restaurant filled up quickly, with all of perhaps thirty seats filled by 6:45 and the conveniently placed park bench outside filling up with those awaiting entrance. In summary, it can be a bit pricey, (30.00 a pie & 27.00 for a calzone) There is a BYOB charge of 4.00, live with it...

I've never heard of ""lambs quarters"" (apparently it's a leafy dark green), but it's one of the obscure ingredients that spots the organic, seasonal menu. The menu has a small, but specialized list of dishes (which I like better than a long, confusing menu). The main dining area is one small room, but there is some outdoor seating. It's got a light wooden interior with candles - kind of like being in a candleiit cabin. My friends and I had dinner there and I had a raviolo (not ravioli) dish which was light, rich, and creamy. The fresh peas tasted like spring blossoming in my mouth. Overall, the menu is organic, new american with some abnormal dishes like pork belly. Service was great - very helpful and friendly. The dinner was about $36/person (no wine, no dessert). Organic food should be priced slightly higher. Go to see how different the menu is. It definitely will challenge your culinary knowledge."

I have lived around the corner for two full years, heard its praises sung on countless lips, seen its allure firsthand as I walked past untold times, and finally experienced the magic for myself this month. Ambience. Balthazar feels good. Homey, not in a quaint way at all, but in the most inviting way possible, exuding warmth, camaraderie, comfort, and class. I don't know how they do it, but it's exactly how you'd picture eating in Paris in the 20th century. Gorgeous wood everywhere, lantern lighting sort of feel, round tables, and waiters in crisp little waistcoats. Food. Strong, very strong. Came in for an impromptu dinner after mingling at the Yale Club one early Thursday evening and got a reservation thanks to a friend. Ordered a fish entree (brook trout, I believe) since a recent oral surgery left me unable to grind through something as hearty as steak. Came over a fresh salad, each and every bite melted in my mouth. Followed it with mixed sorbet: pomegranate, berry, and mango. Inspiring. One of the accompanying ladies chose the creme brulee -- looked perfect and came with the most amazing ginger cookies, so soft and rich. Service. Not intrusive by any means, offered advice on the menu selections and joined our conversation happily, sharing his story from the old country with a smile. Kept our water glasses full and our tablecloth clean, a miracle despite my clumsy friend's best efforts to make an unspeakable mess. I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone; moving a few blocks further away has made it all the more dear to me and I will return frequently."

I was slightly disappointed that neither of my pastries came out warm, they were fresh, but cold, and so early in the morning, I would have hoped for them to at least be re-heated for that lovely feeling that only a fresh-out-of-the-oven breakfast can give.

I don't think anyone who has a clue about Brooklyn visits anything but the entrance to the L on this street. It's perched itself up high but all it is, is perpendicular to SEA. That should tell you enough. High concept, execution problems. Great ideas in the contrast of dish ingredients but execution was a problem all around. From the two, ""It's my first day"" servers to the arson-suggestive cocktail to the undercooked monkfish, the experience left me wishing I came on a better, more together evening. Poutine, peas, and schnitzel executed nicely, nice flavors to mesh. Poor with the not-quite-fermented enough celery broth, lacking barnyard complexity or proper viscosity to hold up to the crisp, gummy monkfish, porgy that yearned to be elevated. My mezcal-based apple cocktail tasted like what happens when a scorned farmer's wife finds out he's been screwing the organic lamb instead of her, and sets the entire orchard ablaze. Oh, and the banh mi poutine was introduced to the table as ""a fusion of Korean and Canadian dishes"" - to which I responded, ""banh mi is Vietnamese"". ""Oh, shit. That's a big mistake, huh?"" Yup."

A friend of mine had one of the desserty crepes, which he says was good, but I think I'll be looking into the more salady ones in the future. Only it's better than salad. Much better. Also had the yuzuade, or yuzulade, or whatever they call it. It was decent tasting, but the taste is a bit too mild for an ade-style drink, and the pieces of rind clog the straw.

My friends scallops came out minutes after we were notified that her plate was given to the wrong table. Unfortunately the scallops were undercooked and my friend weren't able to eat them. We notified another waitress (who was extremely reluctant because I could hear her say this isn't my table) that it was undercooked.  She had the balls to say 'well they look cooked to me' and then she told us 'I will take it off your tab' since we asked her to. Then our waitress finally appeared and explained that they actually gave my friend the other tables scallops and that the plate wasn't rushed. Regardless we all looked at the scallops. They were undercooked. 4). The service overall just gave the attitude of 'I don't care.'  We felt ignored and disrespected. The food overall was good.

This was just okay. The beets tasted canned, but I always love some goat cheese. For mains, both my mom and great uncle got the stone-baked cod.  I thought this was really tasty. The sauce and rice had a very mediteranean flavor to them. Plus the peas in the rice were a wonderful addition. My dad ordered the crispy roasted chicken, This was delicious. Very simple, but the simple things are important! He was underwhelmed, but I always welcome a good crispy chicken. My great aunt ordered the rabbit. Served with rabbit sausage and zucchini, it was my favorite dish of the night. It was succulant and flavorful. I think I've developed a taste for rabbit! And I ordered the halibut.  It was very good, came with mushrooms and sugar snap peas in a light sauce.   Desserts were nice: a caramel blondie sundae and ricotta fritters with cherry compote and olive oil ice cream.  I thought 2 desserts for 5 people was a little low, my family can be so lame sometimes! Admittedly, while I thought my meal was delicious, it was not as exciting as I'd hoped. The problem with the daily menu is that you're never sure what kind of a day you'll end up on.

We arrived as a party of three and our fourth member volunteered to find a parking space while we waited.  My mother was one of the members of the party, she happens to have arthritis and if she can sit, she would be more comfortable.  We asked the hostess if we could be seated as our fourth member will arrive shortly.  She promptly and rudely said ""No"" without any explanation.  I then tried again a few minutes later and just mentioned that our fourth member will be here shortly, and she said that we're welcome to be seated as a party of 3 but our fourth member would have to sit at a different table... even if we're seated at a table of 4 with only 3 people.  It made absolutely no sense and she just came across as going way of her way to be rude for no reason. We finally got seated and thanked god we didn't have to deal with the rude hostess anymore.  A waiter came around and started taking our orders.  One member of our party simply wanted yogurt and granola.  Our waiter practically gasped and explained to us that brunch is a prix-fixe menu and that she HAS TO order items that are either on that pre-fixe menu or order enough sides so that it equals over $15.  I've honestly never heard of a restaurant that won't just give you what you order when it's on the menu.  It was completely ridiculous. Okay we've overcome some awful service milestones and our food actually showed up without any other issues.  I ordered the nectarine pancakes and a side of a bacon and it was actually fantastic.  Maybe the best bacon I've ever had and the pancakes were just enough nectarines to add flavor without going overboard on the fruit which many places tend to do with waffles or pancakes.

I'd recommend topping that off with a pashwari naan for a sweet and earthy compliment to the korma. Finish it up with kheer for a milky delight. (I take my Indian food seriously).

While visiting NYC I was challenged by family to try my first Irish car bomb. After walking all day, we decided to stop into Woodrow's for drinks and food. The staff was amazing. The bartender went so far as to go hunting for the perfect shot glasses for my Irish car bomb adventure. The amazingly friendly waitress, Gina, was very accommodating to our group. There was a large painting party going on in the back (which by the way looked really fun), and so seating was limiting. Gina made room for our party of six and moved tables around so we wouldn't have to sit at the bartop to enjoy our meal. I was surprised to see such a food selection for a bar. I personally ordered fried mushrooms with the horseradish aioli and when I finished those off, I had to opt for fries to indulge in more of the delicious aioli. Though I could base most of my five star rating on the epic aioli and the fact there was angry orchard on tap...what really made my whole experience was the customer service. First with the lovely Irishman behind the bar. I would insert his name here, if we hadn't established nicknames for each other early on. Let's just say that ol' Small Cox will always hold a special place in my heart!  Then there was Gina, our adorable and hilarious waitress. Not only was her service impeccable, but I must say, she has the patience of a saint as far as I'm concerned. I personally witnessed one patron verbally abuse her by calling her ""Long Island trash"" and letting her know that her ""outfit was worth more"" than Gina. I come from the south where we believe in ""bless your heart"" but after insults like that, I'd have to go with ""let's take it outside"". This situation by a customer was appalling, but it allowed for me to meet my favorite of all the employees...the owner. She came to the defense of her waitress, kept the peace, and took time to make sure the rest of her patrons were happy. I was bummed when she ran out of Woodrow's shirts, because I definitely wanted something to commemorate what was nothing short of an amazing experience. I can promise that anytime I step foot in that city, I will be making a stop in TriBeCa for a drink or twelve at Woodrow's. This bar officially holds a special place in my heart!"

The service is fairly poor, and very surly. The staff is not even interested in offering the bare minimum of civility, but they did prepare our food swiftly. However, one person in our party asked for her roll to be less spicy, and after agreeing, I'm fairly sure the counterman made hers much spicier out of spite.

I've been to Rose Water quite a few times over the years and was just there last night. Years ago they were always fully reserved. The question is why most tables have no diners on a Sunday night in a wealthy neighborhood. The idea of serving appetizers, medium sized entrees and larger entrees is clever. I had the duck confit, a medium choice, and it was just the right amount of food for me. My companion had venison, a large dish, which I would say, given I do not like game, was very well prepared. The guy who writes that these recipes are too salty, and that other things are too salty, is not correct. The bread is excellent as has been pointed out. Service is excellent. Prices for food are reasonable: not too expensive and affordable. HOWEVER. The wine list is totally absurd. If a restaurant is going to charge $18 for an entree, the wine list can not range from $50 to $85 per bottle. This is not Eleven Madison Park. They could offer wines in the $25 to $35 range that frankly would be just as good. This is a serious problem, and it means in my view that because they aren't filling up the tables with diners they're trying to bring in money by overcharging on wine. The result is empty tables, because the wine list is ridiculous as compared with the menu. My advice is certainly to dine there, but drink tap water and don't have any wine. You'll have excellent food and you can have some wine later you've bought on your own - and you know you can buy an excellent wine for between $12 and $15 at a quality wine shop.If you doubt that, take a look at the Sherry Lehmann online store."

My all-time favorites are: chicken liver & foie gras mousse (very filling by itself even though it looks like a small portion, the mousse is very rich but so flavorful), onion soup (the layer of melted gruyere on top is comfort food with a capital C), beef stroganoff (this dish is usually very generous with the beef, the beef is tender and the sauce is tangy with the sour cream, the parpadelle is the perfect accompaniment) and the scrambled eggs with asparagus in puff pastry.  The french fries are YUM. Other than those, the grilled brook trout salad (a fillet of boneless trout that has a slightly honey sweet glazing on its skin) is always a hit for those that like lighter foods and the spaghetti carbonara has also been raved about amongst my friends.  Some other recommended dishes would be the duck shepherd's pie and the mac & cheese. Reservations are not impossible but worth making in advance.  Otherwise the wait for a walk-in is way too long.  If you're dining by yourself, there are seats by the bar to the right of the entrance, which are very conducive for solo dining.  The tables near the door by the bar area are very cold during winter time."

Outside:  Katsu-hama has an outside ""to-go"" ordering area to grab a lunch and go.  Hours are 11:30 - 5:00 for this area (see pictures).  Out here, bento boxes for sale with reasonable ""lunch special"" prices ranging from $8.50 - $10.00.  Not bad for midtown.  These bento boxes are premade, refrigerated and then heated up.  However, they are cheaper than ordering the full lunch set inside. Inside:  I decided to go inside for the fresh hot, full lunch set.  I paid $14 though for the full set - entrée, miso soup, and cabbage salad.  The ambiance in the inside of the restaurant is a wood interior with dim lighting, which is a nice eating environment for casual conversation.  There is no music so it can be quiet, especially during off peak hours when it isn't busy. Appetizers in Full Set:  The miso soup was average.  However, I really enjoyed the shredded cabbage salad.  The crisp cool cabbage is tasty with the salad dressing. Entrée:  The panko crust on the chicken katsu is flaky and light.  The curry was quite good with plenty of curry leftover to dip the rice into.  As other yelpers have said, the chicken katsu was rather small for the $14 price tag.  It was once small chicken breast (see picture), but very juicy and tasty. Service:  In my limited experience, the service was quite good.  The hostess was very polite and assisting with my menu questions.  I ordered my lunch to go at the hostess stand and it was ready in less than 10 minutes.  There was a 10-15 minute wait to be seat so a small line was forming since it was noon rush hour. If I return, I will try some of the other delicious lunch items.  I will probably order from the outside instead of paying the additional $4 - $5 for the miso soup and shredded cabbage salad."

I decided to go a different route and try a spicy beef stew. The soup wasn't as thick and hearty as you might expect from a traditional stew, but the flavors were wonderful and it was great option for those who weren't in the egg mood. Get a mechelada or a blood orange mimosa to wash it all down in style. Or if you're not in the mood for boozing, they make an amazingly creamy and rich cafe con leche with organic, fair trade coffee.

In my previous post, I mentioned how I went to a small, cozy café for brunch. Well, for dinner, I went to the antithesis of 'ino, the aforementioned café. While 'ino is Italian influenced, Balthazar is all about French cooking. While 'ino measures the floor space of a garage, Balthazar measures the floor space of a gym. The contrasts could go on and on, but then I wouldn't have time to write up a brief rundown of Keith McNally's popular French restaurant. Balthazar is located in the middle of bustling SoHo. Consequently, the restaurant attracts hoards of tourists who are weary from shopping in SoHo during the day. Right across the street from Balthazar is the MoMA Design Store, so there really is a lot of activities one can do before dining at Balthazar. Upon walking into Balthazar, I was greeted by a tall man who I asked if there was a table for three available. Despite the bustling activity and frantic waiters pushing food around to all corners of the high-ceiling, rustic restaurant, my family and I were seated immediately at a small round table right next to the door. We never made any reservations, so our prompt seating was a pleasant surprise. The décor at Balthazar is absolutely captivating. There were racks of wine bottles that reached nearly twenty to thirty feet high. The seafood area had a large blackboard with colorful, chalk writing indicating the day's specials. The walls and supporting columns looked aged and weary. I felt like I had entered a busy restaurant in France on a holiday weekend. Aesthetics aside, the food at Balthazar was splendid also. There was no dish that lacked in quality in comparison to the others. All the dishes were fresh and tasty. The bread basket only contained one type of bread--white baguette--but was soft and chewy on the inside. The crust sported a nice covering of white flour. For appetizers, I ordered a small steak tartare and a ""Balthazar salad."" The steak tartare was truly a new experience for me, but an enjoyable one. For those who do not know what a steak tartare is: steak tartare is raw meat minced or ground into a stubby cylinder shape. Usually, the tartare has some sort of binding such as eggs and seasonings. The tartare at Balthazar had the texture of sushi grade tuna and had a taste reminiscent of roast beef. The mushy conglomerate was delightful to chomp on because it was very mealy. The toasted baguettes that were served with the steak tartare paired well with the raw meat. When crunch meets mush, you get a nice balance. The Balthazar salad was a bit heavy on the oil but the white truffle oil vinaigrette kept the salad interesting. The salad was definitely more on the savory side, with a crumbly ricotta salata cheese and some salty tinge to it. My mom ordered the homemade fettucini with shrimp, broccoli rabe, and espelette. Although I generally oppose ordering a simple pasta dish at a restaurant--pasta is easy to cook at home--the fettucini dish at Balthazar proved itself to be a substantial choice as an entrée. I was awed at the perfect balance of butter and salt achieved by the pasta. The fettucini itself was also very authentic. Each strand made me want to chew on the pasta for hours on end because the fettucini was cooked perfectly, al denté. My only complaint is that they only offer shrimp with the fettucini. I wouldn't be surprised if the waiters and chefs obliged to a request of swapping out the shrimp for chicken. Lastly, the dish I ordered, duck confit delivered multiple layers of texture and an overarching savory flavor. The duck meat was as tender as ribs that were cooked for hours on end. The underlying layer of potato chips provided a delicate crunch to complement the tender, juicy meat. There were mushrooms added to the mix, which provided yet another layer of texture. The mushrooms were jelly-like and slimy--in a good way. Of course, the frisée that topped this dish was a paltry attempt at making the dish ""healthy,"" but at least there was yet another layer of texture in the dish. On a side note, duck fat is high in monounsaturated fats and includes some polyunsaturated fat. Duck fat is so high in healthy fats that it positions itself to be a great alternative to butter when you want some rich, animal fats in a dish. That's a story for another time however.

They are awesome people; warm smiling beautiful and handsome (I'm not kidding) 3. They tell you ""oh, we may have a table in like 45 minutes, but definitely before an hour, would you like that?"" and you tell them ""sure, I'm waiting for your call. I live 3 blocks from you"" and they call you in 5 minutes and say ""we have a table for  you if you can make it in 3 minutes"" and you leave home in 30 seconds and be there in under 2. The prices are CHEAP! I mean they are what they ought to be. A pizza (they do have one size only, but amazing toppings, fresh toppings) is about $20 and with the toppings it comes to ~$30. You have to bring your own wine, booze, what-ever - $4 charge (I'm sure somebody wrote these somewhere below - or above. But I am so full of dough and stuff and wine now and wield them as excuses for not reading stuff - and making horrible grammar mistakes) Anyway. The ambiance is what everybody said it is, just a beautiful kitchen with low lighting and amazing pizza. We went there 3 people, had a pizza, had a calzone, and I wasn't quite full so I wanted them to cook me something like bread so that I can go on licking the sauce off the bottom of the plate. They not only cooked me bread (pita sort of) but they also gave me another plate full of sauce (the guy just carried it over in a cup and poured it into the plate - must be thinking quite highly of me). We brought our own wine,  well actually, after learning that it is BOYOB we just left people at the table and ran back to the liquor shop and bought a bottle and ran back. The bill was $45. I am so happy, I can cry. Maybe I may have, not really sure there. Oh wait, I can't cry - I'm dead inside. Oh well. [Edit | January 27, 2008] I've been there again tonight. I would like to share a feeling that I've experienced - hence the weird edit. This place FEELS LIKE HOME. I don't know why, maybe it's the music, maybe it's the waitresses, maybe it's the entire aura of the atmosphere. It just does. I feel happy inside. I feel happy when they call me back and say ""we have a table in a few minutes, start running"". Maybe it's the heart warming smile on everybody's faces. I have no clue. It just feels like home in this place. And that pizza; oh mamma mia!"

Our friends have been raving about this place for so long and when we visited NYC this is where, they told us, we NEEDED to go and they were so right. We were greeted by the hostess and told her that it was our first time visiting and that we had made a reservation and she was happy to seat us right away. ""The waitresses here are the nicest"" whispered my friend. She also happily offered to take our coats. She later on told us they put the coats downstairs, so everyone can seat comfortably and no one steps on your jacket , which I thought was really sweet. The BYOB concept is also great as our friend likes to enjoy his very eclectic collection of wine with good friends once in a while and what better way to do it than in a cozy place with great food and an even better atmosphere.For the appetizer we had the pate which was a nicely sized pate with a little salad. It tasted as a good pate should, very rich with a good mix of flavors. And, as could be expected, all of this paired nicely with a glass of red wine. As my main course I had the hanger steak and it was FANTASTIC. The steak was presented thinly sliced and had an incredible aroma and taste to it. I could eat this steak dish every day. My friend ordered the dessert for us and out came the most interesting dessert I've seen in a long time. Ex explained that those were Profiterolles and they were a house specialty. Our server, a pretty young woman with interesting tattoos,was good, and seemed to enjoy her work, which makes all of the difference between great service and acceptable service. Plates were cleared promptly, glasses were refilled without asking, and an offer for a second basket of bread was gladly accepted after we had finished the first. I wish I had remembered her name. Overall, each of the employees that we met were really good at making eye contact, and seemed content in their tasks.What a great experience! Thank you, La Sirene"

I will be back. Now, service. They have 5 star food, but 3 star service. We arrived right as the restaurant opened and were having a leisurely brunch, as it should be. The server came over within 3 minutes of us sitting down and asked if we were ready to order. Asked for a minute. Server came back every 3-5 minutes and was a bit pestering. Restaurant was still half empty, I wasn't sure what the hurry was and I don't enjoy being rushed. Ordered, asked to add bacon to my Royal Eggs. Got a massive plate of bacon that was just ridiculous for one person. I thought, no way $1 gets me this much bacon. I was right. Server added a full side of bacon. Not a big deal, just annoying. If I wanted a pound of bacon, I would ask for it. Lastly, asked to split the check between two cards and server put the wrong amount on the cards... Not sure if maybe it was an off day, or server was new, etc. I'll be back but will request another person. Would definitely recommend.

Don't you realize I'm addicted to pizza and need to tell the world (via Yelp app, of course) that I was in mid-Lucali binge? And then, to make matters worse, you presented ME with, of all things, the bill. You clearly just like to kick me when I'm down, mid-post-pizza coma. That is just WRONG, and what's worse is, I think you kind of enjoyed it. Well, truth be told, Natalie was quite fetching, brought us glasses for our BYO and recommended the spicy sausage as a substitute for the pepperoni that was not available. She also gave us the DL on her upcoming trip to exotic locations (Poland and Ibiza, among others), and gave me all name and manner of grief, despite my overwhelming charm and good looks. Ah, yes, the waitresses are indeed engaging (despite a review or two to the contrary), but as to the nitty, let's talk about Roberto B.'s review for a second: My good man, you can't be serious. You could possibly have walked around NYC, seen the manifold insipid, lifeless, flaccid, uninspired and unappealing pizza offerings and somehow, after sinking your teeth into a slice of this pie, say with a straight face that it's just ""good,"" ""totally acceptable,""  but not great? Pshaw. Your credibility is now officially nil, despite your vehement declarations of intimate knowledge of the etymology and origin of all things pizza. Ha! Your review should indeed be dismissed, as you suggested it might be. Oh, and did you actually comment on the demeanor of the waitresses? You want Mark to SMILE when he's making the pies?! Would that make you FEEL better about the pizza? Tell me you're joking. Pretty please. I mean, perhaps you came on a bad night, I don't know;  in any event, you clearly are not from around these here parts from what I can tell. Growing up here, it was pretty much accepted that if you came out of a restaurant not feeling like the waitress had spit in your food, you really hadn't been to New York City at all. This kinder, gentler Noo Yawk stuff has got to go. Get the faaaaaaaahhhk over yourself. Wait...no ESPRESSO? You poor thing! How WILL you survive? Would you even deign to make the same comment about Di Fara? They have no espresso machine at all! Off, off, OFF WITH THEIR HEADS, I SAY! Let's stick to the facts about this pizza: It was absolutely fantastico. The crust was crispy and the flavor confluence from the cheeses was enough to keep me sitting and eating pizza until underverse come (translation: a long freakin' time, according to Riddick). The only slight complaint I would lodge is that the basil should be spread across the pie and even shredded and it isn't, in a manner more akin to methodology of the proprietor's mentor, Dom DiMarco. The basil is an important flavor component and should be experienced on every slice. In truth, that's just a small complaint about a pie that pays serious homage to a great pizza, and yet succeeds at being just a little different at the same time. Among the notable differences, the crust is crispier and holds up better under the weight of the ingredients than the Di Fara pizza (I don't mind a slightly less resilient crust, myself, but I'm just sayin'). We had spicy sausage and garlic on our pie, and it was savory, tangy, and spectacular. I am looking forward to a return visit for a different variety of pie, and a heaping helping of grief from Natalie.  I imagine I'll have to wait until she's back from her world travels for that, but I'm sure it'll be worth it. Hey Roberto, eh? Quit breakin' freakin' bawls ovah heeeyaah. Go back to Ohio or wherever da faaahk you came from. Geeesh."

My husband brought me here for my birthday dinner, and we were really happy with the restaurant! Let's start this off by saying the food here is excellent. For appetizers, we got the meatball sliders (the order comes with three but you can ask for two instead) and the truffled risotto. The sliders were super juicy, flavorful, and overall delicious. The buns were a crusty bread (maybe a small ciabatta roll?) and the meatballs were really fresh-tasting... These pups are home made. The risotto was awesome. It was super cheesy, the truffle flavor in it was strong but delicate, and the egg yolk gave it a rich creaminess that made the dish totally delectable. Would definitely order this again. Wish I had a giant bowl of this actually. For dinner, we split the pork chop. I usually don't order a pork chop at a restaurant because it's typically not the star/main attraction dish. However, I can honestly tell you this was the best pork chop I've ever had. Really tender, which is often hard to come by in pork chops, and grilled to perfection. The grill gives the giant chop a charred, smoky flavor to accompany it's simple but delicious seasoning. The white beans it came with were bomb too! We ordered a side of the fontina funduta (sp? Cheesy mashed potatoes) and dipped our bites of pork into it. This was an all-around winning decision. For dessert, they brought out a chocolate souffle cake (much like a chocolate lava cake but with a lighter texture) served with espresso gelato, and the pear crisp with marscapone gelato. Both were excellent dessert choices- just solid desserts that weren't overly sweet. The service here is really good, too. Our server, Jorge, was very helpful with food and wine selections, and the waitstaff was very attentive. Only downsides are that it's very cramped/ small (not a great place for large parties, but good for an intimate dinner) and pretty pricey. But the good far outweighs the not so great :) Awesome birthday dinner, can't wait to return!"

According to her the dumplings absolutely rocked that she couldn't even find the words to describe it. I knew it was something I had to try. 5 little morsels of pork packed into a thin sheet of dumpling wrapper, lightly pan fried and dipped in a pitch dark soy sauce blend. it was good, easily the best part of the meal we had but I can still only say that it was only okay for me. It was like a little step above the average gyoza. But trust me I've had gyoza that was better than these dumplings. So I don't know what the fuss is about. Ordered up the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, cause bacon wrapped anything is hard to go wrong, eh? Well it did. Sooo salty! We also go the steak and eggs. It was okay. The steak had an obvious korean flavor to it. Tasted like Kalbi. It sat over a bed of kimchi rice which was too soggy and had a sour flavor that I didn't appreciate. Aren't they suppose to be Korean fusion? I barely recognized anything fusion about it. I mean, are Koreans even famous for their dumplings? It was easy getting a table, even for a Thursday night during prime dinner time. The staff is soo warm and friendly. But the place is a bit tacky. I was looking for something warm and cozy and all it was a tacky diner looking space with the dreaded christmas lights to give it some more lighting. like I said, I really wanted to like it, but the more I thought about it, the more I realize I didn't."

Didn't even bother with dessert - what the people had at the table next to us looked completely unimpressive. Maybe it was an off night, but somehow I doubt it."

We began with the octopus appetizer, which was copious and extremely tasty, and followed that with the filet mignon de porc and the hanger steak. The latter was perfectly cooked, generously proportioned, and had a wonderful garlic and pepper side sauce, while the pork was tender and excellent with a sauce that may have been even better than the steak's. The Bordeaux I had by the $9 glass was also very good. Also, the side-plate vegetables that accompany the main dishes, which in many restaurants would be an after-thought, were also quite wonderful: four or five different vegetables (green beans, purées, etc.) that all sang.

The wait wasn't long which was a huge plus. We ordered eggplant parmigiana and buffala mozzarella to start. I'm not usually a big fan of eggplant but this dish was beyond tasty. There was lots of flavor and texture- esp. for a vegetarian dish. The mozza was very plain, kind of fell flat for a soft cheese. I ordered the appetizer sliced rib-eye for my main since I wasn't that hungry. The portion was definitely appetizer sized (small). Though the meat had good flavor, they were a bit heavy on the salt. I'm usually a fan of lots of sodium but I would bite into chunks of salt while eating which was slightly uncomfortable. My biggest problem w/ the dish was that the cut didn't seem like ribeye at all. I'm positive I was served prime rib, which I honestly enjoyed. But I was expecting a different taste and texture when I ordered a rib eye.

I love that there's not a lot of options, you're going to pizza or calzone (period), because that's what they do well.  It's soda or sparkling water if you don't bring your own bottle of wine or beer, which they very kindly accommodate. The bathroom is so cute and is everything I'd want in my cottage home away from the city.  This is a great place for a date, nice when your mom is visiting from out of town, or of course, with a friend. Just keep in mind that it is a pizza place and service, although quick, is casual. My 'hood pairings - wine from Smith and Vine and wait for your table by having a drink at Bar Great Harry."

But - like most other Harlem restaurants and bars, the service is lacking.  Our server was nice and friendly, but our drinks and appetizers took a while to come out.  During the wait, we were basically forgotten by our server.  I figured we'd get some sort of explanation as to why our drinks and apps took so long - as did our dinner - but we didn't.  That experience, sadly, fell in line with most of my experiences in Harlem spots.  HARLEM - Please, pretty please, I love ya - so I ask that you step-it-up in the service department. Drinks - We both agreed that, although good, they tasted a bit weak. Food - Mine was 5 stars.  My friend was 2.5 stars.  I ordered the beef short rib tacos and my friend ordered a salad.  We were both very happy with our apps.  I ordered the mac 'n cheese for entree - and mine came out hot and delicious.  I rarely eat a mac 'n cheese that can even remotely compete with my own amazing mac 'n cheese - but this place was a close competitor.  Very good.  My friend ordered the braised beef short ribs.  Unfortunately, her food came out cold.  She said the flavor was very good, but it seemed like the food was sitting around for a while. We shared the apple cobbler for dessert - this is LEGIT!!!  Seriously amazing. If they can improve their service, I'd easily up this review to 4 or 5 stars.  I'd love to have regular places to patronize in my neighborhood, and this would certainly be a go-to for me if I could count on more attentive service."

Their menu changes seasonally, and there are usually specials.  A constant is my favorite entree, the Korean steak and eggs, where the skirt steak has an incredible marinade and is immensely tender and flavorful.  Other highlights include the steamed mussels, burger, shrimp-scallion pancakes, potato-parsnip mash, dumplings, and onion rings.  The latter are the best I've ever had, big onion rings married to a tempura batter shell that's crisp, light, and adheres to the rings.  Most other entrees and appetizers I've tried were good, and can't remember ever having anything I didn't at least like. The dumplings gained notoriety after a Food Network feature and I would note that they're well-made, with delicate skin and lightly pan-fried for a slight crisp.  I've grown up eating all sorts of Asian dumplings so to put them in perspective, they're pretty good, but not absolutely amazing. The cozy bar turns out some excellent cocktails; never syrupy sweet or overly strong, they're a perfect blend of the components.  Desserts menu also changes seasonally, are usually quite good, and they introduced me to the lovely key lime pie from Steve's in Red Hook.."

The restaurant is absolutely beautiful -- swanky, trendy and dark, a perfect setting for a date or celebration. It was such a trek to get here but totally worth it. Had an excellent meal here from start to finish yesterday for my girlfriend's early birthday dinner. Our group of 4 was seated promptly for our 7pm reservation. The menu boosts an extensive list of appetizers and entrees and everything sounded so wonderful that it was hard to choose. Luckily we have a tradition of eating family style so we'd get to try 8 dishes tonight, plus dessert later! After picking out a bottle of lovely white(can't remember the name), we decided on the grilled octopus, prosciutto stuffed quail, chicken livers and goat cheese gnocchi for appetizers and seared sea scallops, roasted rabbit, braised short ribs and grilled black bass for entrees. The waiter asked if we wanted the house bread so of course we said yes. IT WAS SOME OF THE BEST BREAD EVER! It was a honey wheat bread with the most crumbly, crisp exterior and hot pockets of fluffy, pillowy inside. So good. Not free though, which was odd, but definitely a MUST ORDER. Anyway, on to the rest -- every single dish was absolutely incredible and an impeccable rendition of the featured protein that I've ever had. My favorite appetizer was definitely the grilled octopus -- huge, tender pieces. The gnocchi was wonderful too -- very minimal goat cheese but the gnocchi was so soft and chewy and tasty. My favorite entrees were grilled black bass and the seared sea scallops. The bass was so fresh and clean tasting with a crisp skin, atop the most delicious saffron broth. I could have done with an extra large bowl of it. The scallops were large, seasoned and seared perfectly. It was accompanied by the most delicious  salad made with apple fennel, brussel sprouts, spicy almonds, scallions and pomegranate. I ate most(all) of it to, you know, make a thorough assessment, heh. I can't stress enough how great all the accompaniments were. There were veggies on pretty much all the plates and they were cooked and seasoned perfectly. We were pretty stuffed but had room for dessert. We decided to do 3 instead of 4 -- apple confit lemon cake, pumpkin pie sundae and cinnamon pistachio pudding. The waiter was very accommodating and had a candle+happy birthday written on the cake one. Anyway, OMG, these desserts sealed the deal. All of them were absolutely devoured in seconds. The apple confit worked so well with the light lemon cake. The absolute best was the cinnamon pistachio pudding. This was some of the best pudding that I've ever had. It was so light and airy and the cinnamon worked so well with the pistachio! I normally shy away from creamy desserts, take a lot of frosting off my cakes/cupcakes -- you get the idea. But, I couldn't get enough of this pudding! ! Only bad part about doing it family style, eh? Ha. Our meal(4 apps, 4 entrees, 3 desserts, 1 bottle) came out to $308 before tip and was worth every penny. If I could rewind, I'd order the exact same dishes again. Return trip? Absolutely."

The raw bar is a raw-esome place to start: from the refreshing oysters to the light, tender cobia, to the other-worldly diced scallops. Incredibly flavorful and served in a light, chilled broth (think ceviche-style, but without the acidity), it was probably the best scallop dish I've ever had. This diver scallop walloped Morimoto's similar dish.  And, although I don't eat much pork (minus the weekly Bloody Mary accompaniment), nor do I have nor eat buns, I went for their most popular dish. And it was bun-believeable. Little did I know the best was yet to come: the chawanmushi with truffle, apple, and quail egg, the chef's special of the night. I get all mushi inside just thinking of this bowl of wonder. Worth the $20+ surcharge, sir. Yep, I'm putting this dish in my top 5. Of all time. Our knowledgeable, super laid-back server recommend the quail entree, which was assembled so artfully, it resembled a forest of sorts, with trees of radish, fig stones, and trails of squid ink. Not even remotely a filling entree as the quail consisted of just four small wing-like pieces, but beautiful and unique. Tasty, but I wanted mo', Momofuku! The only forgettable dish would be the jar of spicy kimchi. Good, but nothing special. Although I basically eat the salt rings of margarita glasses and drink pickle juice like water, I actually found this side to be a bit too salty. Then again, I couldn't see straight after the chawanmushi, so I didn't care.

The pork bun was definitely worth the $1.25. The dumplings however really were swimming in oil. I know that they're only 4 for $1 and I don't want to sound like I'm expecting gourmet quality at that price, but I only ate 1 1/2 dumplings before feeling sick.

The plain pizza with basil was perfect. No point going further. The calzone was good, though not for me, too much ricotta and too little crude backstreet calzone action. Having been raised on thumping chunks of calzone that leak their ingredients all over the table it was a bit too classy. The plain pizza though.... Praise be. Everyone notes the prices.  However, all of this cost us 46 dollars and we didn't need the calzone (and I have a hunger).  For the breath of the experience it is a deal.  Now the problem is I just have to force myself not to go back every night for the next 5 nights I am in NY."

Not my job to find out but they should since it is a cool idea. Other stuff was not memorable. I hate that.

I've been here twice.  Once on the day before Thanksgiving, when their gas had not yet been turned on, and the second time was this afternoon.  A friend and I decided to get tea and an early dinner.  I suggested Home Sweet Harlem since everyone was so nice and welcoming the first time I had been.   I'll talk about both experiences, but first I want to say that I really REALLY want this place to work, but honestly, a few things need to change.   So, my first time there was during a rainy weekday on the eve of Thanksgiving.  It was empty except for one other customer at the counter but I didn't think much of it considering the time and the day.  I needed a place to do some work and was hoping to get some good coffee and a snack.  I ended up ordering a cappuccino along with the soup and salad combo.  The coffee was not good-strong yet flavorless and the milk wasn't really steamed.  The split pea soup was really really tasty and hit the spot, but the sandwich was just some cold cut turkey with cranberry mayo on stale-ish bread.  Meh.   What I did like about  my visit there was how friendly the waiter and the owner were.  Also, it's a spacious place and really has LOTS of potential.  I had planned to go back soon, but wasn't able to, until today... Same waiter, and place was also empty.  I guess we did go at an odd hour, at around 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  The brunch rush, if there was one, was over and it's not dinner time.  I had some tea and we ordered food.  I had the split pea soup again, which was good and the tuna/avocado/sprout sandwich, which was subpar.  It seemed as though the ingredients had been thrown together, with the sprouts hanging out on what was supposed to be toasted sourdough, yet it was cold.     My friend had a turkey burger with mushrooms and sautéed onions.  The burger was also cold.  Did I mention we were the only ones in there? I'm not sure if they were closing, though I'm fairly positive they weren't, but the music wasn't on and the waiter hovered for way too long.  It felt like we were being watched.  The music finally came on towards the end of our meal.  My friend didn't want to complain but did say the burger was cold when the waiter asked how everything was.  He attempted to make good by offering my friend a piece of sweet potato pie on the house, but really, they should have offered to remove the burger from the bill.   The waiter seemed somewhat annoyed after that and I had to say thank you before he did.  Perhaps taking something off the bill wasn't in his power.  My friend was feeling a bit ill afterwards, too.  Not good. All in all, it's the little things AND the big things, Home Sweet Harlem.  Music is important always.  It was drafty in there as well.  And if you mess up, try harder to make good with the customer.  There is never a good reason for stale bread or a cold burger.   Please get better!  You are lovely, but the food and service need improvement.   PS:  I debated a lot about whether to give one star or two.  I'm giving two because I know you can do better and have hope that you will."

We ordered the crab cake [just one] appetizer and the scallops to start.  The crab cake was perfect, with big chunks of real crab meat, but an extra one would have hit the spot.  The scallops were good, but nothing remarkable.   Three of us ordered the steak and eggs....which were pretty fucking amazing.  I think I even heard my friend's friend mutter ""this is orgasmic"" under his breath. Yea, it was that good...that kimchee rice....mmmm mmmm.  Can I have that everyday please?  My better half had the duck confit which was equally as delicious...the duck was perfectly seared and tender. We decided to get dessert to see if there was anything on the menu that wasn't delicious and well, um...there's not!  We ordered 4 out of the 5 desserts [the chocolate cake thingy being the only one left out] and we devoured them all, even as it became ""unbutton the top button of your pants time""...you know what I mean?  Order the bread pudding.  Just do it, for real.  It's big enough for 4 people to split.

When my burger came, with fries (I'd ordered a side salad instead) and my wife's ham benedict was now a salmon benedict, we realised what went down. A quick scan and we saw another table that had arrived 20 minutes after us halfway through our meal. Sadly, no apology from the server.

After I went in, a server came out. We ordered. Another 15 minutes and we got our drinks. So now we're 30 minutes in. 20 minutes after that, almost 40 minutes since we ordered the food I enquired about our salad and sandwich. I was told about 5 more minutes as they were about to cook the bacon. What? I cancelled our order. The excuse? They weren't expecting it to be that busy. There were 3 tables outside and 4 inside. If that's busy, then wow. You guys need to get your shit together. 40 minutes for a sandwich and a salad. With no real apology. As a side note, I saw the cook ( the kitchen is semi open) chatting on his cell phone. Busy right? Business must be good if you can afford to be that flippant with neighborhood folks. Well, you no longer have our business. All our business will be for Wheated and Brancaccios. Much love for Joe across the street!!"

I did in fact finish everything except one sausage. Their katsu is on the spot... except when it sits in a to go box with hot curry for like 10 mins then they become just a tad bit soggy. Their rice was cooked nicely similar to Korean sticky rice and the curry was pretty good (I like it with a little spice). Note that I usually hate curry of all kinds.

I'd definitely go back, although probably for lunch or dinner instead of brunch. because I was in the mood for lighter fare and not the typical carb-filled/meat and potatoes meal that I'm usually craving mid-morning on a saturday, I opted for the parfait (served with frozen yogurt which was interesting and a cool idea for summer) and the egg white frittata. my dad had the chicken liver mousse and the beef brisket with potato hash and poached eggs. I think my mistake was my attempt to eat healthy (my scale never regrets it but my taste buds always do). I found both of the things I ordered pretty bland. the frozen yogurt on my parfait, instead of being served soft, was served in hard, ice cream-like scoops. much more interesting in concept than in taste. my waiter told me it's one of the more popular starters, but I though the whole thing was pretty tasteless. same goes for the egg white frittata. egg whites are usually pretty bland, so they kind of rely on the other ingredients for flavor. apparently there was pesto and baby artichokes in there, but the only thing I could really make out were the potatoes. wasn't bad, but I loaded it with salt and pepper and still got bored after eating half of it. my dad's brisket, however, looked great. he seemed to enjoy it too, and I'll admit that I was eying his plate the entire time. and after glancing around at the tables nearby, I ultimately decided that I'd just made poor choices. nearly everything else I could spy looked great: pancakes, pastries, burgers, fries... it's a neat space, and I'm a fan of the fresh, organic/local approach. next time I'll just leave the scale in the closet and go for the gold."

We ordered the prix-fixe and I chose the pork tenderloin, and the cold tofu for a starter. The prix-fixe consists of a starter, miso soup, a choice of a katsu, a prawn katsu and a croquette, rice and ice cream for $22. While it sounds like a good deal, I was a little surprised by the size of my pork katsu - it was only 3 pieces. The main as a result, was a little less than satisfying although the panko breading on the pork and prawn were good and fried pretty well. It also came with a generous serving of cabbage. The beef tongue was pretty tasty too. The food is good, albeit a little pricier than I expected. I did hear that the surprise entree has a much more generous serving, so perhaps I'd try that instead of the prix-fixe. Service was a little below average - the indian servers seemed a little incongruous in a japanese restaurant and did not seem to be bothered which of us had ordered which dish; we had to rearrange our dishes at each course."

Every time friends come from out of town to visit, I take them here and they're always raving about it afterwards. I normally get the Shami Kabab roll (lamb) or the Beef Tikka roll, which are both delicious. If you're looking for variety though, I wouldn't get these two as a pair since they taste pretty similar. As a fan of spicy food, I really appreciate the herbs and spices and how they add a nice kick. The Aloo Masala roll is also pretty good; it's definitely a different kind of spicy flavor which is nice, but I still prefer the meaty rolls. No matter which roll you get, though, the griddled paratha bread is perfect and is consistently one of my favorite parts about these rolls. Crisp and chewy at the same time, warm, and it even has its own subtle flavor from the grill. Each roll is a pretty decent size.. 1.5 - 2 is plenty for me. Normally if I'm there with someone else, we each get a different roll with the daily special deal (2 for $9 or whatever) and then just switch rolls so we both get a variety. Works out great and it only comes out to $9 - $10 per person. I've never had a problem with seating, and the wait for the food is never long. I'd say it's pretty much Indian fast food, but with quality still retained. My only problem is that they don't have options for cups of water or anything, only overpriced water bottles, which becomes inconvenient as you'll find that these rolls make you very thirsty. But that's just a small price to pay for an otherwise fantastic meal!"

I had a salade niçoise with champagne and finished it off with the Caramelized Banana Ricotta Tart with banana ice cream for dessert. Just an unbelievable dessert, and it only costed $9. Perfectly-sized meal - although, the Indian busboy took my unfinished niçoise away from me long before I had the chance to finish it (that was really the only thing that annoyed me, and before I could say anything, he had already slipped it out from under me, and was nowhere to be seen.) The service at this restaurant is fabulous. Aside from that unfortunate busboy, the entire team was top notch; from the door girls, who safely stored my shopping bags downstairs, to the greeter, who brought us to our table, and even pulled the table away from the bench, so I could easily take my seat. I'd have to disagree with some of the other reviewers, who say that it's a touristy place to eat. If you come on the weekends, sure. But during the week, this is just your average high-end French restaurant, complete with plasticized women, and overactive Instagram-ers. I gave this restaurant a 4/5 stars because of the bitter experience with the busboy. The other 4 stars are well-deserved for the quality of food, promptness and attentiveness of service, vibe of the other patrons (we met a great couple there that night, and other neighbouring tables were inter-mingling too), and the cleanliness of the restaurant and all facilities. They really should teach busboys the same ""rules of engagement"" as the servers, though. It may spare them a few more disgruntled customers."

Today, I ordered the vegetarian polenta with poached eggs, others got the frittata with sunchokes and cauliflower and the special:mushroom bread pudding with poached eggs. My actual meal was a poached egg on a goat cheese polenta cake with cremini mushrooms and brussel sprouts and chermoula. I thought the chermoula would just be an accent, but the entire plate had been doused so every thing I ate was covered in that pungent taste of lemon, cumin etc. The plating was also terrible, I had one poached egg on the polenta, then a pile of creminis/brussel sprouts and a random poached egg on the side. More importantly, the eggs were really runny, and given that my stomach hasn't felt great all day, I think they were underdone... On the other hand, the frittata was over done and greasy, boo! The saving grace of the meal was the special, the mushroom bread pudding, my friend seemed to enjoy it. Also, another strike is that the coffee wasn't good, had a bitterness from over-roasting--  although that also might be because I've been spoiled by Stumptown's hairbender blend.

Beef stew is a favorite dish of mine and I thought it would be exceptional at farm to table restaurant. It had beans in it, which would have been great but they didn't capture any flavor. It tasted like they were added after or not cooked long enough in the stew. We finished our meals and didn't order dessert for a good reason.

The seating: the concept of eating in a classroom was an interesting and different experience. Elementary school classroom setting + two star restaurant doesn't really go together. They could have still pulled it off by keeping in mind the ultimate goal of dining. The individual desks look awkward to sit at but the benches were still not conducive for groups of more than two. They should combine two school benches together so that you can still sit as a group/across from other people. Sitting like ducks in a row is much like sitting at  a bar and isn't conducive to conversation. Menu: the menu is on the chalk board, which is cute, but again they still need to have individual menus. People with their backs facing the board were awkwardly  turned around (not for a short while, the menu was large, confusing, and interesting). I know their menu is daily but they should still post online. Because their dishes are so unique a detailed description is required! Service: 5 stars for EXCELLENT service. Food: It's pretty hit or miss. The waiter was EXTREMELY friendly and more than willing to explain all the dishes in detail. I had the Jambon di Paris, which is shards of ham with tuna mayo and shredded bits of croissant on it. This dish was unexpectedly cold-may be better as a warm dish. The ham was thin-sort of like sandwich meat. The tuna mayo gave it a really fishy taste.  The two were not complimentary. The bits of croissant was very good. When the waiter came over and asked how the food was I told him I was not a fan. He said he just wanted me to have an amazing experience and to pick a second dish. I chose the potato uni, which I also disliked :[ This was little potatoes, a poached egg, and japanese uni covered in strong orange/citrus version of their ""hollandaise"" sauce and garnished with flower petals.

Now on to the food... Four things you must try when you go are: 1) Onion Soup Gratinee  - it is really really good. The cheese is plentiful and really is  perfect with the soup. The more you eat it, the better it gets.  I know, $11 for soup is a bit nuts, but worth it. Share with a friend! 2)Chicken Liver & Foie Gras Mousse - So creamy and delicious, served room temp with a frisee salad and toasted country bread. Better then the cold Liver Mousse at Le Express, but comparable to Jubilee's. 3) Escargot - they are served in the shell (which now i understand why there were toothpicks on the table). I was not able to fish it out with my mini fork, but delicious and the parsley butter garlic sauce is comparable to Le Express. Soak your bread in it! 4)The Duck Confit! --the Duck Confit is served with a mushroom sauce and a Frisee salad. Perfect way to cut the grease of the duck. It was a nice big duck leg and roasted perfectly. Skin was crunchy, meat was tender. yumyum. We also ordered the Seafood Ceviche (which is cooked calamari, prawns, crab in a lemon vinagrette) served on nice big Radicchio leaf. And the Seared Halibut entree. Though not memorable dishes..they were both decent. I am definetedly a fan. This place doesnt deserve 5 stars, because they are a bit overpriced for the food.

I came on a Saturday night at 8:30 with 3 others; we shared the jalapenos with cheese (not fried- just fresh peppers cut open with melted cheese), good creamy, simple, purist guacamole (bits of pomegranate were in it) and house made tortilla chips.  We also had elote, my favorite Mexican grilled corn with mayo and paprika (thought I do prefer this to be a bit cheesier.. Pinche Taqueria anyone?) For dinner, we all had the enchiladas (well one of us..the chicken), and tacos: fish and chorizo. I had the fish; they were fried but not greasy at all because they were fried at the right temperatures.  All green tortillas, and supporting lettuce, etc were super fresh. As for drinks, I enjoyed my spicy michelada (choice of tecate- it was spicy!), and my friend seemed to like the margarita.   The one disappointment of the evening was our dessert- it was a chocolate tres leche cake which was way too dry. Service was warm, fast, and polite.  I see a lot of groups like to come here for celebrations, but, note the place is small and pretty tight. You can opt for bar seating if you must.

I really hope Billy, the owner/chef  offers this as a special, because, damn....DAMN. I'll be dreaming about it. Sides were mac and cheese and baked beans. The mac and cheese was rich, salty, satisfying and sprinkled with bacon. I think you can opt out of the bacon, but why would you? The beans were AMAZING. They were pretty spicy and at least 50% butterbeans. I thought that was a nice twist on a classic side that I don't usually care that much about. The atmosphere  was really fun and casual. Long tables and chairs give the room a picnic feel. There is a back room, possibly for events and private parties. Perfect for live music, which I hope happens often.

You see I used to be A Grimaldi's fan while not the best pizza in the city it is really close to my house, the lines there weren't a problem because I was a regular and the staff cut me ahead. However as I kept going to Grimaldi's over the years I noticed the pizza declined in quality while the clientele kept getting more and more touristy. I finally got fed up one day when in the Summer I had to rush my meal and a fat Texan tourist kept taking pictures with his flash on and annoying me. At that point I realized Grimaldi's had become too touristy. So I heard about Lucali's on yelp and went to try it. I had to wait around 30 minutes but it was a nice summer day so it did not bother me. When I got in the restaurant it was exactly what I was looking for there was dim lighting a laid back atmosphere and not an obnoxious tourist to be had. Then the pizza came, now I have had pretty much every great pie in New York from Lombardi's to Di Fara's and I have to say that was the second best pie I ever had (Di Fara's still takes number one). I then had the calzone and it was by far the best calzone my lips had ever tasted. Since then I have been going to Lucali's as a regular and have not regretted it. While some people complain about the wait and the service, it is a place that favors locals, which is fine with me as I am a local myself. Also Mark and the Waitstaff are great if you are pleasant towards them. That being said I can understand people being surly after an hour wait so my advice call ahead that is what the number is for. The only real complaint I have about Lucali's is the price is pretty high, however that is basic supply and demand economics."

The Israeli Breakfast was a snore save for the labneh and the spicy harissa I borrowed from my friend's Burekas, and the tomatoes in the accompanying Israeli salad were pale, mealy, and generally low-quality. The Crispy Dough, on the other hand, was much more interesting, albeit not at all crispy - very chewy, not quite sweet or sour, and really tasty.

The smiling waiters are kind and easy on the eyes and the menu is short - yet a bit American for lunch - mostly sandwiches including a corque madam and an onion gratin and frittes.   Cute boy waiter recommended the burger but I went for the mussels, which were too small but the broth was exquisite swimming with jewels of butter and sweet shallots.  Frittes were good too, but it was the cute hidden courtyard that stole the show.

I had heard such great things  about this restaurant that my husband and I made special reservations for dinner, and it was good, but it wasn't great. First, the wait staff: The host was very nice. He felt so badly about telling us they couldn't seat us at our reserved time that he came outside to find us and tell us he had moved things around. HOWEVER all the other waiters were horrible. Our server threw bread down on our table without even looking at us or saying hello. Her head was actually turned in the complete opposite direction, a feat of great contortionist skill. She never smiled at us once and we really felt like she just threw our food at us all night. Uncomfortable to say the least. The decor of the restaurant is strange. It could be very nice, with the modernist wood ceiling and butcher block tables, but they really crapped-up the decor with flea-market style ""art"" on the walls. It can't decide if it wants to be modern or shabby-chic and the result is just a big-ole-mess. Now for the food. All I can say is ""eh."" It was good, but not great, and I have had much better for the price. I'm not quite sure what all the hype is, but I don't think we'll be going back here anytime soon."

I went for the slushie dark n' stormy--oh yes! They pack a good gingery kick, and are more balanced than the slushie Bajita rosa, which I thought was a touch  too sweet. My friend and I had worked up an appetite walking over from Prospect Park, so we dipped into the food menu as well. If you're wondering about portions, the relatively cheap sides come in generous servings. The spicy coleslaw, which isn't that spicy but is quite tasty, fills a cereal bowl. I don't eat meat but I imagine it's a good complement to the jerk dishes. I encouraged my friend to pair her jerk pork with it--that was just a big ol' pile of meat. My peppered shrimp were delicious and juicy (so juicy that I ruined my dress with a big splatter when removing the head of my first shrimp), but not as filling a portion as I had hoped. To this we added plantains and festivals, which are these fun cornbread-like fritters that come three to an order. They are served with what is hands down the best thing in the joint: homemade coconut ice cream. I could eat nothing but that ice cream for the rest of the summer. It's that good. I would buy it by the bucket. And last but not least they serve a good and boozey Mai Tai, which our friendly server described as being ""very utilitarian."" Somehow my drink tasted better and more fruity than my friend's, but both packed a punch. And to top of what was already a pretty great dining experience, our server brought us each an extra helping of that tasty coconut ice cream once we'd finished our food. Clearly, this is the way straight to my heart."

This place is awesome, and a really good change of pace restaurant from your typical dining experience. This place is a solid 4.5 star joint. Came here on a Thursday night with a group of four friends, and ordered a whole mess of deliciousness. Tonton gyoza - tasty gyoza served super crispy on a cast iron plate. Really yummy, but still just a gyoza, albeit a really tasty one. Collagen gyoza soup - the broth here is just so rich and delicious I found myself going back for more over and over again. Of the three soup dishes, this was the best. The flavored were the most rich and clean and without distractions. Gyoza here were tasty and meaty. Pork belly with yuzu miso paste - super tender, super flavorful slices of pork belly, and the miso paste adds a nice depth of flavor. Hakata tonton hot pot - we got this once with a spicy broth, which was my least favorite broth of the three. It's a good soup, don't be mislead, but the spice covers up the natural rich flavors of the broth. Tons of veggies and meat in here, and we added in some ramen after. Hakata motsu hot pot - I am a sucker for intestines, so pretty much anything with it in there I will enjoy. The flavors were clean and you could get all of the fatty deliciousness in there. Grilled motsu - this item isn't on the menu. We had seen this in previous reviews, and I was craving intestines, so we asked if they could make it for us, which they did. These were awesome. Crispy, fatty, and delicious. Ask them for this, and maybe you will get lucky. Grilled pork tonsoku - here's my disclaimer for this. You must love fat. Skin fat. Fat fat. Fatty meat. Thankfully, I love fat, so I loved this. Don't attempt to eat this cleanly; you will fail. Just get in there breaking it apart with your hands and putting bits on a spoon.  The flavors are great, and I would get it again in a heartbeat. Pork buns - super fatty and with just enough BBQ sauce. The meat literally melts in your mouth. Make sure you get this if you come here. My only negative about this place was it was super hot inside. The windows were closed, no AC on, and we had multiple butane burners cranking on our table. I get the novelty of watching it cook on your table, but I would have been just as happy having it brought over cooked. Total for all of that food, plus half a dozen sapporos, came to a mere $50 a person, all in. Really great value for what you get. Make sure to do the grilled tonsoku, pork buns  grilled motsu, and collagen gyoza soup if you come. The rest of your meal, I leave to your stomach to decide."

An elegant and romantic ambiance, cozy seating, enhanced with warmly lit hanging lights. I started with the Devils on Horseback, dates wrapped in bacon served with dijon mustard. If those are devils, then I must say it's a thin line between heaven and hell, as I don't know what ethereal place these bacon wrapped dates brought me to, but they were definitely out of this world. If those were the horsemen of the Apocalypse, then the world is not ending soon enough! Being on a budget, I opted to get a Burger with swiss, which was so flavorful I wondered whether I had forgotten what a burger tasted like? It could have been because it was the following act to my NDE with the Devils on Horseback and seemed to be the first thing I've tasted in this life. My friend and I shared, or were supposed to share (but he very rapidly inhaled all but a few), the Truffle Fries, which were a poignant and delightful coupling with my burger, or simply the cap to the evening's meal. Though I longed for dessert, I thought it best to be better safe than sorry (I only had $40 on me, holding myself firm in moderation). My friend got a glass of Stella and the Frisse Lettuce salad, which somehow rendered him full. I went last night, and have an overwhelming (and probably uncontrollable) desire to return this evening. I wish I could afford to be a regular, and can't wait to go for lunch and brunch! I had learned one of the collaborators to open this place is from my favorite coffee place in the city, Abraço. If they had that coffee there I would honestly move back to Greenpoint right away! It is the ideal date (and bacon wrapped date) restaurant: beer/wine/cocktails, gourmet otherworldly food, ice cream made in house, and of course, oysters. The combination of ambiance, food, and mood lighting proved to be an extreme aphrodisiac and I promptly felt all senses taking over. If I hadn't been there with my friend, I don't know that I would have been as discriminating with any ensuing indulgences. My only recommendation is, if dinner is followed by romance, be sure it's somewhere you can sleep afterward...because stimulation overload seems likely."

They have pre-fixe menus and you have to order at least $15 dollars worth to eat there...which was a little different from what I'm used to.  But, it forced me to order (even though I had already eaten prior)...so I went for the breadbasket (small muffins, scones, biscuits, etc) and seasonal fruit.  Okay, why is the bread so good?  Um-um-good.   All I can say is ""ground hog's day.""  ahahaha-- sorry, inside joke.  ;)"

Their red wine selection  is just alright; nothing that stands out. Mostly Argentinian Malbecs and a couple of California and Italian wines. Waitstaff was nice enough but over eager service....they would come by every 2mins to fill up an almost full glass of water and what's worst, they kept topping off our wine glasses even though they were full. I know why they do it. I was a waiter back in the day. Pushing wine in this way is tacky and very off putting. A great waitstaff is invisible discreet and effective. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh expecting this type of service at Porteño, but come on this is New York and at their price point I would certainly expect a lot more. The food I have to say that my friend and I came with lots of expectations. Based on the reviews but the food fell waaaayy short of what we expected. For aps we ordered empanadas. I had the spinach and the beef. The beef was not bad but certainly not something I would rave about: the spinach however was bland. It tasted like a a frozen spinach hot pocket. Quite bad. For our main my friend ordered the pork chop and I had the rib eye. I must say the rib eye was well cooked (I asked for medium) but again it was very bland and tasteless. Also it was so thin I thought they had made a mistake with my order. I just have never had such a thin piece of rib eye for $30!!!! Are you kidding me? I know you got to turn a profit  but this is ridiculous. If you go there ask them how thick the  steak is. You'll see what I mean.   The rib eye was served with chimichurri which was really not bad and with a warm kale and bean salad. I love kale and white beans and have to say this was pretty ordinary. My friend said his pork chop was just ok....from my end it looked good, nice and thick in a bed of mashed potatoes but I did not taste it. We did not stay for dessert. We knew better. I have to say, I'm an above average cook and pretty decent food connoisseur . This is not my first Argentinian restaurant.....I want to ask Porteño, how can they serve this type of basic argentine cuisine and do such a terrible job at it? I could have made our entire meal at home with much better results...not trying to brag but it blows my mind that a place in NYC can serve this and still be around.....only time will tell. Is not about fancy it's about good honest food and Porteño most certainly lacks that. I would not waste my money there. There are plenty of good Argentinian restaurants in Manhattan and the buroughs."

I tasted the grilled cheese and couldn't believe how delicious it was. We had a chance to chat with the owner and one of the servers and really enjoyed getting to know them.

Now I know why this restaurant was rated 4.5 stars out of 5 prior to dining here. Excellent food with excellent service. To start off, I changed the reservation time because some of my friends were going to be late. Once I called them several hours prior to dinner, they said ""No problem. See you then!"" Once I got there, about half the party was 30 minutes late or more. So once, I got there, I sat by the bar area to grab a drink with one of my friends that showed up on time. The staff could have easily given up that table to someone else, considering how many different people came in trying to get a table. They didn't do that and kept their word on holding the table till at least half of us arrived. That shows how much they care about their customers. Now, regarding the food, we started off with some empanadas and polenta. I was waiting to have a high quality empanada and it was muy delicioso!! The breading on the outside was light and fluffy and the inside of the empanada, whether it was spinach, corn or beef was cooked perfectly. Already felt like I was in heaven. As for the entree, I have been waiting a long time to have Argentinian steak because it's not cooked and prepared in the same way as the American style steakhouses here. It's also not so much the melts in your mouth type steak, but it is very juicy and tasty. Once I ordered it and took my first bite, well, my wish was granted. I will have to thank the genie in a bottle later on. Here are a few notes for anybody reading this. This is NOT a place to bring a large party, no more than 6 people, unless you plan to reserve the whole restaurant. This place does not sit more than about 20-25 people, including the bar area. It's a great date restaurant. The place is small, but has a very cozy and homely feel."

The breads were perfectly toasted and the ingredients were all excellent. The prices were fair (not Bánh mì cheap but not hipster expensive) 8-9 bucks is average. The gelato is 3 bucks a scoop (little pricey but very nice). In both cases I split the sandwich with someone else and both halves were AMAZING. When the Bill M. announced another Brooklyn ride with a stop here, I was the first in line. And again the 2 paninis I shared (different this time but I forget which) were delicious. I think the only downside is its location, it's in a mostly residential neighborhood in Bensonhurst (which is far for me). But since I have a car, a motorcycle, a bicycle.. I'll drive to avoid hipsters, no problem. Also the lines CAN get long if this place gets a flood of people (no thanks to the 20+ bicyclist) but I'd rather it be made with care than to be rushed.

From your party's request for another round after being ""cut off"" it is clear that you were trying to instigate unnecessary conflict (which you admit in your post). Such behavior is typical of inebriated people and certainly not the good judgment of people who are ""in control"", as you want us to believe you were.

I decided to go with the tofu edamame salad crepe, which came stuffed with tofu, spinach leaves, edamame, carrots, hard-boiled egg, green beans, and pistachio bits. I loved how there were plenty of tofu cubes and hard-boiled egg chunks - the ""meat"" of the salad. I also really liked how the pistachios added some crunchiness. One thing I didn't like, though, was the dressing/sauce. The menu description says ""Eight Turn sesame dressing"" and ""Eight Turn tofu sauce,"" but I didn't pick up any hint of sesame, and the sauce tasted too mayonnaise-y for me. The place itself is super tiny - there's the counter where you order, and then a very small counter in front of the window where there's standing room for about 2 people. It'd be nice if they added a stool or two. Also, be warned: if you're taking your crepe to eat on the go (which you probably will be, given the lack of seating), take plenty of napkins. Your crepe will get messy towards the end. Conclusion: Lots of cool crepe toppings, both savory and sweet. The savory crepes make a good lunch or light dinner.

So I ask the guy behind the counter who seems nice for a plain bagel with 4 extra thin slices of salami. He rings me up and says ""$6"", confused if he understood my order I asked him to double check and explained there is no way that is the price of a bagel with 4 thin slices of salami on it. He points up at a sign and says ""you ordered a salami sandwich- that's the price"". Again I tried to reason with him and explain that I am sure that price is for a real sandwich with a good amount of meat on it- but he just shrugged his shoulders. Realizing I was being taken advantage of I said ""well maybe then you can give me the remaining salami that I am paying for wrapped up as cold cuts- to be fair"" and he then laughed and said "" I never did that I guess Ill talk to Sal about that"". There was not even a consideration of what I was saying or so much as a dollar taken off the price. Basically the price of salami on a sandwich is $6 even if you get 2 slices of salami- LOL WHAT A JOKE.  Now I know I was making perfect sense because any bagel store in the neighborhood makes the same thing for $3 or less- so I knew coming in there was a big mistake. Now the lady working with him who has been there for YEARS heard the entire conversation and tried to pretend she didn't. She knew I was right, but instead of stepping in she continued to ignore the situation. SO anyway I will continue to walk past this shit hole due to the poor customer service I received this morning and I live right around the block.

Grapefruit infused cocktails? Roasted Lettuce? Meat Plate? Perfect Margherita pie? Cilantro ice cream? AMAZING. It would be an understatement to say they went above and beyond, really. You just have to go here. They do food and the experience of eating it right. Full stop. They deserve all their accolades food wise. I only hope everyone who was in the same boat as us on Saturday appreciated that when you're running a restaurant that is doing the volume they are, that sometimes things are beyond their control. Two fat thumbs way up Roberta's. I'll be coming back and recommending you (!!!!) fo sho."

I've gotten a few different egg dishes, and various sides, all have been delicious.  My favorite by far is the burekas with scrambled eggs.  The burekas are these little pastries filled with feta cheese, olives and other deliciousness.  I'm not a big fan of Israeli salad, but it's very fresh and my girlfriend is always happy to have my share.  The labneh cheese is my fav.  It's great to eat with anything, eggs, crispy dough, straight off the fork.  The crispy dough is the only thing that's been underwhelming - mostly it's just a bit oily for my taste. On my last visit I got a potato pancake as a side and it was great.  Very large, well seasoned, all around awesome.

We were brought water right away and shortly thereafter someone took our drink orders. Mojito's, wine, pacifico and caipirinha's were all in the starting lineup. The menu is a bit overwhelming but not in a bad way...in a good way; there are so many tempting items to pick from. The food is described as Latin fusion with varieties from all different types of places including Spain and South America. We decided to eat in a pretty traditional way by ordering a bunch of Tapas including Arepa's, Tacquitos, and Guacamole. They were all so flavorful. We help on to 1 menu and just kept ordering different ones as we went on. With help from the staff, we had a full meal and it was really a fun experience.

You may be off put by the fact that they only have pizza and calzone on their menu - but it is definitely quality over quantity here. Both are amazing and the best I've had - yes, it takes a lot for me to say this definitively. What makes Lucali's pizza so amazing is the sauce (I never thought marina sauce could be that good) and their supremely fresh ingredients (the portobello mushroom and mozzarella were fantastic). The calzone was also great - the crust was flaky and nicely charred on the sides, and the inside were piping hot with oozing ricotta and sausage. We also asked for a side of the marina to go with it...you must do this. I must also comment on the atmosphere. The restaurant is very unassuming, intimate, and rustic. I love the fact that it was renovated from an old candy shop because vestiges of its past are still present in the decor. They also don't have a formal kitchen, so all the food and brick oven are out in the dining area with you. Very nice. Amazing pizza & calzone.

Mine had a little foam which stayed put through my entire sipping of it. As did the sprinkle of cinnamon, so I could smell it with every sip but it was not overpowering. We ordered and Victor (everyone's best friend LOL!) came over and said we did a great job of ordering, but he had one problem. Huh? We didn't order the salmon brulee.

I am usually very hesitant of tartare I don't eat it generally. This was amazing. It actually tasted like a brulee, the crunch, the sweetness combined with the salmon which was outstanding and did not have that ""raw fish"" taste that scares me! ENTREES: My husband had the sangria braised short ribs, so tender and flavorful and I had the fish ribs with coconut rice. AGAIN, I am sad! I will never have this again unless I go back! The fish ribs were unlike anything I've ever eaten. Very meaty, when I saw the rib casing of the bones I said oh my God a river monster fish! The glaze was delicious (orange chipotle bbq). DESSERT: We let Victor pick for us, since he hit such a home run with the salmon! We had a plate of mini cookies with salted caramel in the middle served with a Peruvian fruit ice cream I wish I knew the name of the fruit! It was soooo good! Along with coffees with brandy. The waiter who had brought our menus got my coat for me and put it on for me and apologized again for the initial tiny delay.

A little steep but worth it cuz you get over a pound of meat. 2 people can easily share it if they aren't too hungry. I had a hard time finishing mine. Interestingly, I think the pastrami might actually lean on the... err... leaner side but there is just enough fat in the brisket to mix the two. It's also amazing how soft the meat was. Even the bread was soft - almost as if it wasn't there since it was completely overshadowed by the meat, but it held the meat until the very last bite. The 3 slices of pickles that came with the sandwich helped balance out some of the meat. They also have something called a hungry man sandwich which has everything from the sandwich above + corn beef and just more meat in general. If you finish it under 9 minutes, you get a t-shirt and get your name up on their board. Apparently the record is 3 minutes and if you can break it, your meal is free.

Coming here is a bit of a strange experience - walking into a museum (tell them you're there to eat and you get in for free to PS1) to hit up a classroom with small desks and menus on chalkboard.  It's a place to be seen, to say you went, but it's also pretty good for what it is. Seating note: as the resident giant yelper (6'8"") the seats and table were a bit small, but workable for the time there.  The space between the seats and the tables are a bit small, so if you have big legs it might be a tight fit - I think a few of their tables or bar seating could work then. Lots of staff, and an esoteric menu without enough information.  Our appetizer we got based on nothing ended up being delicious, my brisket was bad because I had no idea it would be served cold (the beets were hot though).  Feel free to ask how it's prepped beforehand, be smart and you could be fine.  The smoked chicken of my girl was divine for me, not so much for her. If you are a picky eater or don't eat some things for religious reasons, this place can be a bit tough - at least half of the dining options included shellfish or pork, which doesn't work for me.  But there were a few viable options too for me. Lots of people walked in, looked at the menu, then eventually asked for a table - a few did leave though.  It's normal and accepted to do that, just don't take forever to make that call as you end up standing awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant right next to people eating while looking at the big board.  A minute or two is okay and acceptable, don't be a dick though. The pricing isn't horrible, and you get free admission to the museum with your sticker (or at least we did).  Decent beer (Sixpoint) options and wine bottles, if you want to be that person to order a $90 bottle in a classroom.  Trust me, nobody will judge you. Net net, it's hit or miss good food based on your tastes, in a setup that seems sweet for 15 minutes then just is, and is in fact cooler than you are."

Unlike a different reviewer, I thought it was really unique and cool that they essentially used their door frame and chalk for the waiting list. I seriously doubt people would purposely smudge the names ahead of them just to get ahead in wait time. When we were seated, I will say the tables are pretty close to each other so you'll be packed quite closely. We ordered the: 1. The Croque Madame - which was very tasty, thick and heavy. Although portions looked kinda small at first glance. They're actually quite thick and heavy so you'll be fulfilled after the meal. There was cheese on either side of the bread which was melted in and still hot from the kitchen, which brought out so much flavor from the filling of the sandwich. 2. Waffle Sandwich - my favorite. It came with butter and maple syrup on top, a lot of cheese in the middle, bacon, and I believe an egg as well. Everything just blended together in a beautiful melted mess of sweet, savory, cheesy, crunchy and lightness. I've never had anything like it and would come back again!

So if you like a restaurant you would hope they get their liquor license. Regarding cork fee: I think this is illegal as well. What a patron must demand is a wide range of prices in both beer and wine: economy for those on a budget and class for those willing to spend. Also proper storage of wine is necessary, I have noticed that many bottles are stored in the back near the hot hot temperatures of the kitchen. In my first restaurant this resulted in wines becoming cooked or corked and a lot of bottles being sent back. I have had to do this on 2 occasions at Roberta's. If you like the Pizza here try the pizza at Phorum  it was really good and the serving size a bit larger"

I had spent my college years working as a waiter in a fine dining restaurant, so I'm sensitive to how stressful the job can be, and always try to be pleasant.

I wanted to speak with the manager about the poor food and service but after battling and shoving through the mob of people at the front to get our coats, I lost the will.

Yesterday around noon, I ran out of the office on a hunger mission; the only problem was that I wasn't craving any one thing in particular.  And then, about five-minutes in to my lunch prowl, the words 'Kati Roll' seemed to appear in flashing marquis lights.  ""Sweet,"" I said to myself, ""I've been meaning to try this place for years."" I returned to my desk armed with a bottle of some fancy new Nestea concoction ($1.50) and two Kati Rolls: Chicken Roll ($4.75) and the Achari Paneer Roll ($5.25). A Kati Roll closely resembles a burrito, in that savory ingredients are spread atop warm paratha or roti flatbread and rolled/wrapped. Each of my rolls was constructed atop buttery, blistered paratha flatbread.  Pickled red onions and a spicy, green coriander spread bound each protein (chicken, paneer).   I wasn't sure whether the key ingredients of each roll - chicken and paneer - would find compatibility with the above 'binders,' but I was pleasantly surprised.    * Chicken Roll: large chunks of grilled white-meat chicken breast were moist and juicy with a subtle curry aftertaste, which was fragrantly accentuated by the coriander spread.    * Achari Paneer Roll: I don't think that I've ever had paneer this soft and dewy.  The slightly-crunchy, pickled red onions contributed the gift of texture to the otherwise delicate paneer.  Each ""cube"" of cheese had the slightest buttery crust, leading me to believe it was stir-fried/sauteed prior to service. Conclusion: at least 30-minutes had elapsed from the time that I left The Kati Roll Company, to the moment that I actually began eating.  Regardless of the fact that my rolls had gone from warm to 'room-temperature,' I found them to taste delicious.  Kati Rolls are not only portable, but they are made with precision (no sauce-spillage/leakage, ingredients stay intact).  And best of all?  They make for a cheap, filling, inexpensive, and delectable meal.  I can't wait to try the other eight versions!"

The staff mesh with each other like similar to the finest quartet at The Bushwick Starr. So well orchestrated that you become engrossed by the movement of food coming and going though the ultra small kitchen into the uber small restaurant.. There is a uncanny sense of caring about your meal and satisfaction with your overall experience as a short term guest in there establishment. I realized last night that it is so true size really doesn't matter if the execution is strong and memorable! The food is thoughtful and well presented. Light and flavorful but memorable The vibe is positive and pleasant but not overly west village granola . The service is pleasant and positive but not rushed or artificial. Sincere being the operative thought! So to sum it up there are many choices and lifetime of experiences some memorable to our palate's some to our hearts some to the left side of our brain and some to the right side .

Initially huge proponents of the dinner and brunch fare at the original Glady's, we were surprised to see the rather dramatic change in direction from this relatively new restaurant in the neighborhood. Devastated that our Bubie sandwiches were a thing of the past, we were by no means averse to the idea of Caribbean food and so we went to this very different iteration of Glady's one recent Friday evening. While, aesthetically, not much has changed - with the exception of a few pot plants and the addition of a great deal of rum to the bar - the menu retains none of its former greats. Having been fans of The Islands (though it has been a little inconsistent of late, much to our disappointment), the standard was set rather high. Drink selection: If you enjoy rum, this may be your place. Though we haven't the slightest idea as to what constitutes a good rum, we did dabble in a flight and enjoyed the selection. Food: The jerk chicken was perhaps the best dish on offer and was enjoyable, though not spectacular. The oxtail stew and curry goat were predominantly sauce with very little meat thrown into the mix, which was a shame. The rice and peas were not nearly as flavorful as the options available at The Islands and the yams were hard chunks of starch. Conclusion: Overall, we wanted to enjoy Glady's Caribbean as much as the Glady's of yore, but it wasn't to be. At least not yet. While we both agreed that we may make it over for a take-out jerk chicken if we're feeling terribly lazy, I don't think this is as interesting or as well executed as the Glady's we knew and enjoyed. What's more, when The Islands does perform to its true potential, it far outperforms Glady's fare -- considering the proximity of the restaurants, one hopes that this new iteration of Glady's improves the quality of its offerings."

Seated right away at a table for two near the window, far enough away from the hustle and bustle, though very close to our neighbors, not really a bother, but be advised, you could be nearly bumping elbows with folks. We were served promptly by a very efficient, and attentive, if not the friendliest server (everybody is allowed to be tired of working I suppose). Just as a little snack to start we had the deviled egg. Very tasty, with a spicy kick, though far too salty for my taste, personally. 3 stars. Both my date and I ordered the burger, mine I asked for rare, which...yeah I suppose it was nearly there; delicious, however it was cooked. The roquefort cheese on the burger added a very unique and strong flavor, and they used just little enough of the cheese so that it didn't overpower the beef itself. Again, for my tastes, the cheese was too salty, but the flavor was distraction enough. Onto the perfectly grilled bun I added a dash of ketchup (which I don't think is your typical brand...not over-sweet) and it was lovely overall. One minor thing...the burger is served with fries...I won't even call them shoestring, more like ""angel hair"" fries. I discovered there is such a thing as too thin. Tasty though they were (anything deep fried with salt and rosemary is bound to be), I actually found it rather difficult to eat them. I resorted to a rather bizarre technique of smushing my burger into a pile of them and eating the ones that stuck with a bite of my burger. Strange I know, but effective. I seldom find myself enamored with French fries, but when I do, they are thin, but I can also tell that it's potato that I'm eating! Burger: 4 stars Overall a very good experience, and even though I can't help but feel like some of what I am paying for is rent in the West Village, I do like the neighborhood as much as the owner apparently does, and will almost certainly return.

That's how I discoved the Meatball Shop. When I arrived it was a weeknight , but busy. No tables or any seats at the bar. Fortunately I was just one person, so I just hovered for a few moments and a bartender/server graciously helped me find a seat at the bar. The menu was simple and straightforward, which I loved. Various meats, sauces, and ways to have your meatball served. I opted for a pork meatball sandwich with spicy meat sauce. It arrived quickly was delicious. No complaints. They also serve whiskey floats (ice cream and whiskey for the uninformed), which are also delicious. Meatball sandwiches and whiskey floats are basically the way to my heart. Consider me a fan. Coming with a group would probably be very difficult at peak hours, but that doesn't change how good everything tastes!"

My friends and I came a little earlier to order drinks, what a big mistake that was. My friend ordered a peach Margarita, it tasted like anything but a peach Margarita. When we asked to exchange it, the waitress, Gina, attacked us. She started shouting at us in front of everyone. Not only did she refuse to exchange the drink she called me names, and laid her hands on me. When the owner finally showed up all she did was apologize. She didn't express any concern about the way her staff acted towards us. I told her to look at the surveillance camera so she can see how inappropriate the waitress acted. STAY AWAY from this bar!!!!

First, we saw the prices.  Yes, yes, we should have looked first, but we figured that if the food was delicious, then the price wouldn't matter so much. Second, when I received my food, I felt like a fool.  I ordered the French Toast for $19.50.  What I got was two slices of dry brioche and some limp, bland bacon.  That's $10 for each slice of toast!  Like I mentioned earlier, if it was delicious, then cost wouldn't be an option.  However, it was meh.  Insultingly forgettable.  My boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  It was also meh. If you want a scene (or if you want to pay too much for forgettable food and to be surrounded by tourists), then go to Balthazar.  If you want solid brunch fare, then go to one of a number of other great places that this city has to offer (westville, grey dog, clinton st baking co, good, cafe cluny...for french toast, I should have checked out nearby jane, where I haven't been in years, but whose toast left a fond mark on my memory).

Honestly I don't know why you would pursue any other wine ordering strategy. I split the grilled pear salad with a friend and ordered the oxtail ragu for myself, per everyone's recommendations on Yelp. The salad was really, really good and big. Well dressed, had the right amount of gorgonzola, and lots of pear to go around. The oxtail ragu was also delicious, though I would have liked a little more meat in it! I think the best part of it was the fresh pappardelle pasta; soooo good. I can't say I tried much else from the menu as the person next to me had the same order, but everyone left happy and full. Actually, we left stuffed because we DID order and split I think 5 desserts which included tiramisu, panna cotta, and something else I can't remember. The tiramisu came very strongly recommended, but I actually liked the panna cotta the best. Lastly, the service was fantastic. I think our server's name was David, and we'd probably talked his ear off by the end of the night.

The main course consisted of a Fettuccini Alfredo with grilled chicken: again a great dish, well cooked pasta and a tasty delicious sauce. The chicken was excellently grilled and very tender with a very fine taste. My friend ordered a Linguine Nettuno, which was a great dish as well: tasty salmon, shrimps and fine tomato sauce. The dessert was an Italian cheesecake, again very tasty and good. The price was very decent, especially considering the location and quality of the food. There are a couple of over priced venues in the area and it is easy to think that Villagio suffers from the same syndrome but no, they offer a great value for the money. In fact so great that I don't see a lot of viable options close by besides Petrossian or Porter House (TWC) for different cuisine, though and also a different price category.   The only detail to notice is that the internal noise level can be a bit on the high side, mostly due to the acoustics of the room. Because of this, candlelight dinners aren't the strength of Villagio - for those, other establishments such as Petrossian are better. I would say that the pasta dishes is where Villagio shines: they are the best value. Some appetizers are almost the same price as a pasta dish, which can be worth to note: in comparison with the main courses and desserts, they can be a bit on the high side of the price scale.

FOOD: For Thanksgiving we had the Pre Fixe menu which started with a very delicious soup, followed by a salad with vinegar, nuts, cranberries etc.. After that we got the main dish which was turkey filled with super delicious things and meshed potatoes. My cousin had salmon instead of turkey and it was no problem to replace that. For dessert we could pick between cheesecake and pumpkin pie. We took both. And it's a good amount of cake and it was fresh. At least we think it was. And then we got coffee and tea. Besides we ordered red and white wine which made the night even classier. LOCATION: The moment we walked in they check our RESERVATION and took our coats. It was tide, cozy and a bunch of people sitting there between candles. It's a kind romantic, average and a little classy feel. It's french so the tables are small. SERVICE: If I could rate the service I would say it was EXCELLENT. Friendly, professional, fast, welcoming and again I'm super glad we picked this place for Thanksgiving.

I would have given this place 5 stars, if it were not for the broken promises relayed by the hostess/Maître d.' When I first arrived, I asked how long the wait would be, which the hostess said 45 minutes to 1 hour. I was put on the list, with the time recorded as 12:07pm. I decided to run some errands and come back at 12:30pm. Yes, there were several parties ahead of me. But there were some well-dressed people (assuming regulars) dropping the phrases like ""I have a reservation,"" and they were seated immediately. So next time for fun if you wait there, see who gets seated by the well-dressed Maître d' with a French accent, and who gets seated by the other 2 hostesses. This landscape reminds me of an article I read awhile back in ""The Los Angeles Times"" magazine on how where you get seated is compared to a parking lot. If you drive a Bentley, your car is parked up front, a Benz in the middle, a Pinto in the back (but in this case it's to the right closer to the bathroom). Also there are separate lists, one for the restaurant portion, and one for the bar portion. The bar portion is said to be a faster wait, however why don't the ""regulars"" ever sign up on that list? Probably because they didn't want to pay the same price for cuisine, and sit uncomfortably there. Also, because they can drop the phrase ""I have a reservation."" Actually, you might try that the next time, and when they look for your name, You can say you spoke to someone over the phone. They are put in an uncompromising position, and have to seat you. Also, make sure when you say you have a reservation, to use your last name. That's what I seemed to observe. I was thinking should I bail or should I stay, but after already waiting 58 minutes, I really wanted to see if this place was that great, if this place was worth the wait. After being seated at 1:21pm (they were 14 minutes late), I was able to decompress. I believe the Maître d' seated us (which was sort of like an apology), but he pushed the table in an aggressive matter, so it was more like a back-handed apology. -- *** I tried the salmon and the Niçoise salad, coffee, and glass of Rosé. The salmon was excellent (probably the best cooked one I've had) but I wasn't privvy on the cut-up veggies. The salmon was so fatty, but perfectly cooked (not overdone, not to raw, color still remain consistent throughout, texture was almost like Toro). The Niçoise salad was amazing as well. The tuna was seared on a grill (you can even taste a genuine charbroil/seared flavor, see photo). They use 3 types of tomatoes (yellow, cherry, and sun-dried). You can tell that the sun-dried tomatoes weren't re-hydrated and from a bag, they were fresh. The hard-boiled egg was perfectly cooked, and the dressing was simply oil and vinegar (which is a good thing). I thought the bread that accompanied the salad was a mismatch in texture and flavor. The coffee was watered down. I highly recommend skipping that, and going next door to their bakery for coffee. I know it's a wait, but at least it's in a to-go-cup. For dessert, I saw the peeps at the next table order creme puffs that looked like they were filled with ice cream, and the waiter serves chocolate syrup right after he places them in front of you (kind of like how most places ground pepper after they serve you pasta), just in case you want to try a cream puff with chocolate, and one without. My iphone ran out of juice, so I decided to try dessert menu next time. Instead, I tried the Hazelnut Cocoa next door (their bakery). The cocoa was very rich, and you can even taste a hint of hazelnut.  I highly recommend it even if there is a line."

Coffee is included in every brunch plate but I don't drink coffee. I asked if they could replace my coffee with tea, like every brunch place I've ever eaten at, and was told coffee is included but tea is extra. Really? I never encountered this before. Not everyone drinks coffee. Ordered the falafel platter and was disappointed. The falafel was a little too crispy and lacked flavor. The hummus was not great. I've had better from the Trader Joes $2 container. Tried food from my friends and wasn't impressed with anything either. We all left disappointed from a place with such great reviews.

So trying your luck at the bar means darting your eyes every which way to notice someone making their way to leave, because, well, some people don't get the protocol that you were there first. Eventually my friend and I lucked out after 25 minutes of standing with two stools at the bar. We started off with a couple tall glasses of Brooklyn Ale and foie gras and I ordered the bar steak and frites. And as we waited, we watched as our friendly server/bartender was set up with some supposedly hot friend of this one French chick who's obviously a regular there. Nice going, dude. He wasn't even trying and here he gets some girl's number. Anyway, the food: Foie gras was excellent and so were my frites. But the steak was ok - I was expecting better, but then, for that price ($20-something) in a New York restaurant, I guess it was fairly decent. I really enjoyed the French-inspired atmosphere and could tell that the regulars here were treated like gold. It was an extremely comfortable place to be, even though it was insanely crowded. We could have sat at the bar for eons, which I'm sure many regulars do, but we had to scram. Not to mention some lady with 6 shopping bags eyeballing my seat. Or was she eyeballing my ""seat""?

The $13 duck over rice gets you half of one side of the breast, over rice and some greens which I was told were red mustard frill. The duck is cooked to a perfect, tender, pink. The duck is juicy and the flavor is fresh. The skin is crisp, and reminds me of good Chinese style barbecued duck, except that it's not as sweet and hasn't been hanging all morning. The rice and greens are extremely satisfying after soaking in some of the flavorful drippings of the duck breast. I also had the broccoli salad, which was ok. The smoked eel vinaigrette was not particularly strong, providing only a slight smoky flavor, and the crispy rendered duck skin added some crunchy texture. It was served chilled, and for $5 had a decent amount of broccoli, when you compare it to similarly-priced sides at Otto or Torrisi.

Being the typical New York food snob, I quickly checked yelp for their ratings and noticed they most received great reviews. So I took a chance and decided to try it. I liked the atmosphere and the fact that the guy behind the counter was not only cute but friendly and approachable. He offered suggestions when I seemed unsure of what to order and I decided to take his suggestion on the duck confit sandwich. I'm so glad that I did, not only was it delicious, it was filling (came with salad and fries) for only nine dollars! The low cost made it taste even better. Living in the neighborhood, I've experienced first hand the pressures of gentrification to move residents/families who have been there out and replace them with hipster roommates who drive the prices up. I was worried that this shop was just another big name restaurateur taking advantage of the neighborhood boom and the higher rents (meaning higher paying clientele). So when I paid, I asked the guy behind the counter who the owner was and to my surprise he pointed to the chef who made my food! I can totally get behind supporting the little guy, the small business owner who wants to share what he loves with the community. I will be back most definitely. I'm also excited because they deliver, something else that is hard to get at my Brooklyn and Dean location. I wholeheartedly recommend this place, you won't be sorry you tried it :-)."

Home fries were really good, if a bit greasy, they could have done with a paper towel for a second before being plated. On the plus side the staff are super nice and really attentive.

Definitely enough for lunch, and only $8.25 (or thereabouts, I can't remember exactly). It also came with a free miso soup :) I was so excited about discovering this place that I came back the next day to pick up a bento box. They have regular and slightly fancier bento boxes ($7 vs $8 or something like that), each carefully assembled.

The appetizers included: 1/2 dozen oysters (very fresh and refreshing), escargots in garlic butter, chicken liver and foie gras mousse (this was delicious and the most popular at the table), and terrine de lapin (interesting, but I am not a fan of meat jello). For our entrees, Balthazar allows families to SHARE and that was certainly good news for all of us. Our entrees covered: Grilled Brook Trout (the crispy skin was divine), Grilled Lamb T-bones (This was my favorite - medium rare and just SO juicy), Cote De Boeuf Roti and fries & onion rings (If you are a true fatty or foodie, PLEASE order the ONION RINGS! You will not be disappointed! They're submerged in beer batter!) Drinks were also heavenly.

But ladies and gentles ..... for our finale! It's the dessert course is which almost everyone's favorite.

BEST THING EVER on their dessert menu), Creme Brulee (I enjoyed that as well), Mango Cheesecake and Profiteroles!

There were some special beers listed on the board but I wanted some sort of a cocktail, so I asked to see a menu. So far so good.

OK, they were there 1st maybe they asked for more drinks. no, he's not making anything. He rings up a tab, OK I get that too. But now I've been there about 10-15 min. Finally he turns towards me I ask for my drink, he makes it, a waiter comes up he makes a drink for him and then rings me up.

But here's the kicker 1 of us is vegetarian, so she asks him for a recommendation, guess what he is a vegetarian too!! so how did he know both pork dishes were good???? I don't know, wish he would have told me. Anyway we got the deviled eggs, they were really really good. Someone had the burger, said it was good, I tried the potatos that came with it, they were ok, more like chips than fries. I guess my expectations were too high for what the whole experience was.

When searching for a place to make brunch reservations on Opentable yesterday, the menu page for Odeon showed they had BLT's.  My 8 year old daughter LOVES BLT's, so we booked a table at Odeon.  Drove from Brooklyn, paid $18 to park, got seated, and then discovered the brunch menu did not have a BLT (it's on their lunch menu).  I figured it would not be a problem to get one anyway as it is just bread, lettuce bacon and tomato.  I asked, they refused.   So I ordered a side of bacon and a toasted bagel (both on the menu) and asked for a side of tomato and lettuce.  Had to assemble it ourselves at the table.  Not the end of the world, but I find it surprising that they couldn't make a simple BLT for an 8 year old.  Even more surprising is that they preferred to have the customer assembling the sandwich at the table rather than having the kitchen do it.   Thanks, Odeon."

We started with the fried maitake mushrooms with prosciutto and bocconcini. perfectly crisp and light with beautiful pieces of prosciutto and cheese. YUM. This really made me wanting more and I started to have great expectations for the other plates we ordered. We then shared the seared scallops, pork belly with bean salad, bacon and mustard dressing and the sautéed trenne pasta with beef Ragu, kale and parmesan. Surprisingly the biggest stand out was the trenne pasta. I don't think I've enjoyed a pasta dish this much in a long time. The pasta was crisp from the pan and the beef ragu was so tender and flavorful. I could eat this dish again and again. I know for most people this is a scandal to say but the one thing I would pass on next time would be the scallops. While they were still good, the bed of quinoa they were placed on did nothing for them and the sauce wasn't anything special. My date loved his pork belly, I just think it could have done without the bean salad.

We just showed up at our estimated time, waited for a few extra minutes, then got seated. The space is gorgeous, dimly lit, and open. I loved watching the chefs make the pizza behind the butcher block. The wood-fired oven is also totally visible from the dining area. It's fun to watch. Our waitress brought us wine glasses and uncorked our bottle free of charge, and we enjoyed some Chianti before our appetizer came out- the best calzone in the Western Hemisphere (and let's be honest, do they even have them in the Eastern Hemisphere? Not to generalize here, but I'm just saying). The calzone was huge- I ate about 1/5 of it and any more would have been too much to enjoy my pizza later. I let the boys eat the rest of it. I recommend getting the original calzone, full of fresh mozzarella, fresh ricotta, and parmigiano reggiano. They serve it with home-made marinara sauce and this complements it perfectly. I also recommend ordering the large pizza with no extra toppings- just the free basil. This was thin-crusted-fresh-cheesy-perfection. No words can do it justice, just come here and see for yourself. They are generous with the reggiano on here too, and along with the fresh FRESH mozzarella, the thin crispy crust, and the perfect amount of sauce, this is pizza perfection. All of this, and including tax our bill came out to $34. We upped it to an even $40 with a tip, ate like kings, and only paid ~$13 each. No Beyonce/Jay-Z sightings, but I guess that's not Lucali's fault so I won't remove a star for this."

After reading all the good reviews, and BBQ being one of my favorite food, we had to drive down to Red Hook, and check it out. When we first walked in, we were both a little confused on the ordering system, one of the owners came right over, and explained everything to us, he was extremely nice, giving us a brief disruption, showing us the place, and making small talk. I am all about customer service! And this place has it! You can tell right off the bat that they care about their restaurant, and the customers, this you don't see so often anymore. Especially in such a large establishment. Ok on to the food....the ordering system is basically standing on line, ordering your meat first (we had the pulled pork, brisket & wings) they cut the meat right in front of you, give you the amount appropriate for you, and weight it. Then you order the sides (we got macaroni & cheese, potato salad, and baked beans) after that you pay, get your utensils, and sit down. Basically cafeteria style, reminded me of high school. The drinks even soda you have to order from the bar. I've been to other places with this style of ordering, it doesn't bother me, except the fact I had to go to the bar for soda, and keep getting up for drinks. It would have been nice if someone would at least take drink orders. But other then that which isn't much, doesn't make me dislike the place. The pulled pork was delicious, so was the brisket, the macaroni & cheese had a good kick to it, I don't know what was in it, but it was a little spicy. Would I order it again? Hell yes! So was the potato salad! While eating another owner came over and asked how the food went, great guy! Funny personality, explained that the wood on one of the walls came from a hundred year old barn that was destroyed after hurricane sandy, thought it was nice to speak to us, and many of the other people eating. I've ate at a lot of BBQ places in Brooklyn, and this one is one of the BEST! It has a unique taste, but a very delicious one! Can't wait for a nice warm night to go on a Friday night when they have a live band, enjoy some BBQ food and beers. Thanks for the GREAT hospitality! Keep it up! Thanks for a great dinner! Keep smoking that delicious meat!"

The deviled eggs are a nice way to start, although I feel like three egg halves is a weird number. Come on, dudes, just throw that other half on there. The beef rendang is totally sultry--only complaint being that several times it's been served with plain slices of cucumber instead of any sort of pickled treat, as advertised. Love me some pickles. Missed me some pickles. The ayam bumbu is a lovely--if $18--little thing. Crisp chicken and some sort of vegetable (according to the website right now, chayote squash, but they were doing a lot of kale for a while). It unfortunately comes with the tomat sambal and not what I ignorantly refer to as ""the green one,"" which I assume is the mateh sambal. It's, in my opinion, the best of the three. They used to give me a side of it for free; now they charge $2. Bummer. Not a huge fish fan, but the market curry is excellent and filling in a bewildering, I-need-to-unbutton-my-pants kind of way. Overall, points for great flavors and for giving a much-needed heat injection to Greenpoint. Points taken away for somewhat high prices, constant menu tinkering, and the cucumber shenanigans. 3.5 stars."

Sorry to say - bf and I had date night here last Sat and it was a wee bit of a letdown in terms of food.  We made a reservation to come at 845 but had to wait about 10 minutes or so to be seated. No biggie but whatever.  Definitely only suitable for a group of 2 or 6 at most- it's a pretty tiny restaurant.  The waitress asked us if we wanted a bread basket- and there go out of their way to note what is GF on the menu so I suppose they have a lot GF clientele.  The bread basket was alright - there was a grilled baguette like bruschetta, and blah room temp. hard pan de bono type of thing. We started off with the appetizer - it was a special but seems to be on often - the grilled octopus salad with spicy mayo and well-dressed salad. This was really good.  Bf then had the pan seared cod (men, good, well cooked but not too well seasoned) with a quinoa salad (good, standard), crispy scalloped potato (yum but hard to mess up).  I had the famed carbonara dish which had a great cream/mushroom sauce... my biggest complaint here is that there was literally no pancetta, shrimp or salt... just like of cream, and mushroom. The pasta was well cooked though. The wine selection was one of the better aspects of the night - I had a great chilled Chard from Mendoza, and one of the Malbecs. Both had mean pours took on the exact flavors we were expecting. For dessert, we had the ice cream sampler which was yummy- dulce de leche, mate (yum!), and sabayon (yuck!- also not well constructed and practically melting when we got it). I'm not sure if they totally made it in house because there were ice chips in some of it.. especially the sabayon... The sampler came with little macaroon looking things except they were a lot more dense than macaroons.

The roommate and I checked it out for Dine-In Brooklyn week, and though it was packed, we were seated immediately with a reservation at a cute little table tucked away in a cozy corner. The small dining room opens up into a larger covered patio area, and is punctuated by skinny bookcases stacked with old-looking volumes on wine. If a) my roommate wasn't in a serious relationship and b) we weren't both straight, it would have been the perfect setting for a date. We ""splurged"" on the wine pairings - $14 - which gets you three, 3/4 full glasses of wine to complement your appetizer, entree, and dessert. It turned out to be a  solid decision and worth the extra dough, even if the final wine selections - a sherry for me and a port for her - only served to remind us the dessert wine is gross.

Recette was one of the first restaurants that I visited during my early years in New York, and back then I was impressed by the inventive yet well-executed dishes coming out from the restaurant. The Gander is a lot bigger than Recette, and has more traditional menu formats, with a bunch of large entrees along with appetizers and pasta options. While I think the level of inventiveness is somewhat below that of Recette, I still liked most of the dishes that I tried. You have to start every meal at The Gander with briscket ""tots"" and potato and mustard. These were really tasty bites that I wish I could have more. ""Buffalo"" sweetbreads with blue cheese and celery, an inventive take on buffalo wings, was also a winner. I don't think I've seen beets being incorporated into pasta dishes, but the beet tortelli with goat yogurt, coconut and almonds, despite my initial reservation, turned out to be a very delicious dish with pretty unique texture of the tortelli and beet working together. The two entrée dishes, while solid, were somewhat less impressive. While arctic char with coco bean and pork chop with cippolini onion were both very well cooked, I've seen these types of dishes before. They seemed to be designed to cater to a more mainstream crowd and I wish chef Schenker could show some unexpected elements that could really wow me. Given the size of the restaurant (seating around 150 people) and its location (Flatiron area), I can understand that it perhaps makes more sense to play safe, but my initial impression from the starters and pasta didn't carry over. Same goes for the dessert that I shared. While crème brulee semifreddo with milk chocolate, walnut, bacon and whiskey was certainly a very tasty dish, I did miss that element of surprise that I saw from the awesome s'mores dish at Recette. Perhaps due to its size, getting a reservation at The Gander isn't too challenging. When I showed up for a dinner on Sunday, it was still slightly more than half packed. The restaurant has a full bar with a condensed wine and cocktail selection. The ambiance of the restaurant definitely feels a little more tamed than the absolute neighborhood charmer that is Recette. I do think The Gander is a place worth visiting, with a lot of well-prepared dishes that can please the majority of diners. Just expect that the shade of brilliance from chef Schenker at Recette is a bit toned down."

Cookshop, in the heart of Chelsea, fulfills all of those dangerous quotas. So naturally, it sat loudly atop my ""must-eat"" list. Unfortunately, those restaurants tend to live on hype instead of execution and service. This was certainly the case with Cookshop. I excitedly went to the teeming restaurant for dinner with family, and immediately noticed the lacking service. Our waiter was extremely inattentive, but it also appeared as though the restaurant was understaffed. ""Maybe the food will make up for it,"" I positively thought. I should have stuck with my generally pessimistic, New York roots. The beet soup was chalky, the pork was overcooked and fatty, and the chicken was bland and had overwhelming sauces. I'd also like to mention they were ""out"" of two dishes we wanted to order, so that too was disappointing. Despite my dinner experience, I somehow couldn't just let go of Cookshop.

Mind you, the restaurant wasn't even packed, so it's not as if orders were flying in. I assume the chef was also reading the newspaper and playing BrickBreaker. Like dinner, brunch too missed the mark--the pancakes were bland, the compote was too sugary, and the syrup was probably Duane Reade brand (do they make syrup?). With the plethora of great food in Chelsea--and in New York for that matter--there's little reason to waste your time and money in Cookshop. For a laughable average of $27 per entree, you could be slapping high fives at Spice Market with Jean-George. Trust me, he loves high-fives."

You do have to wait for your entire party to be seated. We ordered four tofu bowls (two regular beef bowls, one regular mixed bowl and one hot seafood bowl), as well as one L. A. Galbi. The banchan (the reason that I gave this place only four stars) was rather sparse and didn't have a lot of the things that I normally love, but the kimchi is really sweet and they were good about keeping them refilled. All of the orders also came with a small fried fish as an appetizer. I was the one who ordered the mixed bowl, and it seemed that they follow the Chipotle rule - that is, ordered half-and-half always results in slightly more than half of each. Would recommend. ""Regular"" wasn't particularly spicy, but, combined with the piping hot broth, was delicious. Would definitely come here again, especially because it was really affordable and service was prompt."

Could have been a slightly bigger portion but I'd rather have quality than quantity. Then I tasted my dish....wow....amazing, fluffy, pillowy gnocchi.

The seafood salad had big chunks of lobster meat and squid, shrimp and crab in a light olive oil dressing. It was excellent. The roasted peppers were good. The baked clams acceptable but not memorable (to be fair, I had chosen them), and the salad was surprisingly tasty. I reminded me of the salads that my grandmother used to make, with oregano and red wine vinegar on chopped iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. For pasta we had rigatoni with broccoli rabe and sausage and ravioli in marinara sauce. The rigatoni was cooked perfectly al dente, with plenty of broccoli rabe and pork sausage, but the sauce was a little thin. The marinara is excellent, and the ravioli were good (a little soft to my taste). Accompanying the pasta came the meatballs - one big one each. They're about the size of a baseball. They are incredibly moist, and indeed, medium rare on the inside. They have this excellent, garlicky, romano cheesey flavor. I fully understood the hype on these meatballs from the first bite. It would have been easy to quit there, but we weren't finished. Jumbo shrimp oreganata and chicken scarpariello, chicken braised in white wine with hot and sweet sausage, and hot and sweet peppers. The shrimp may have been great, I couldn't honestly tell you because the chicken was absolutely delicious. It had exactly the right mix of salty, savory and hot. I could've eaten another full tray. By the time we were done, the place was really jumping.  All the other tables were full, and the famous juke box had been turned up. The owners were making the rounds of the room - it was truly delightful. I didn't want to go home (and the difficulty finding a cab up there almost ensured I didn't). Bottom line: the food runs the gamut from B+ to A+ - and there really is some A+. When coupled with the atmosphere, it is an unparalleled New York experience.

Automatically that's probably where your mind would go to if you are a native NYC'er but it definitely is not filled with the ""BROTASTIC"" clientele you get at those venues. Probably because every1 thinks everything in TriBeca is ramped up in price, which is true for the most part, but MP is so relaxed and laid back. I've gone on a Saturday when the place was pretty full and was still able to move around, drink and mingle with friends. Also went recently on a Sunday where the place had a decent amount of people in it watching the NBA Finals match up between the Heat and the Spurs. Definitely a solid place to catch any major sporting event they have 4 huge TV's at the bar and then i'm pretty sure i remember seeing a huge projector screen in the dining area (maybe 2 of them) and then I think 3 or 4 more flat screen TV's in that area as well. Food and Drink wise the place is pretty good, I've had the Calamari and Mac N Cheese, it's not Babbo quality but you aren't supposed to expect that, it's definitely above average. My biggest problem is that when I come by when it's supposed to be slow but has more than a few patrons there's only one person outside doing everything. Pouring the drinks, serving the food, and also doing the checks as well. You can't let that happen whether it's on a Sunday or Saturday that shouldn't be, gotta have two people working that floor all the time in addition to whatever cooking staff you have.

It's a pretty chill, laid-back, family-type atmosphere.  The service is OK - not the best, but not the worst.  Decent wine list - we got a bottle of Malbec. Appetizer - we ordered the Vegetali Alla Griglia (mixed grilled veggies with balsamic) and the Parmigiana Di Melanzane (eggplant parm).  The grilled veggies were decent and the balsamic dressing was a nice touch.  The eggplant parm was AMAZING.  Probably one of the best eggplant parm's I've had in a long time.  It was full of flavor and sauce, and I would honestly just be OK getting that as my meal (in a larger portion). Pizza - one of my friends was vegetarian so we split the Ortolana (mushrooms, zucchini, eggplant, basil) and it was good.  Some of the veggies were a bit undercooked and I understand that it's thin, but not technically thin crust, but the front of the pizza would completely fall apart when we would take a slice from the pie.  It was a bit chewy and I think overall, the entire pizza was undercooked.  I was really hoping for something a bit better so I hope it was just an off-night."

My experience wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. I ordered the Chicken Thai crepe. It was quite different than the crepes I had in Harajuku Street in Japan. What's great about the crepe is that it's thin and cone shaped. What I dislike about the crepe is that it didn't deliver the crispiness I was expecting out of a Japanese crepe. I would hear the crunch from every bite from the crepes in Japan. The crepes from Eight Turn Crepe are far from crispy. The crepes in Japan had a lot of sauce. As for this Chicken Thai crepe, instead of it having a lot of sauce, it had a light drizzle of sauce, making the crepe a lot drier than expected. Aside from the Japanese comparison, the crepe was a little on the spicy side. The sauce was delicious, but I wish they gave more sauce. White meat chicken is dry, so I wish they would add more sauce to make up the dryness. I also ordered the royal milk tea. It tasted great. Would I recommend this place? Yes, if you haven't eaten the crepes in Japan. Because if you can't compare these crepes to something better, you will think these crepes are awesome. Would I go back? Maybe not. I'm not sure if spending a total of about $15 on a crepe and drink is worth it, especially after paying only about $4 for a crepe in Japan (compared to spending $8-9 on a crepe from Eight Turn Crepe)."

The Panamanian presence of Crown Heights has been declining through the years even before the most recent wave of gentrification on Franklin, but various Panamanian-owned businesses, social clubs[2], and churches still persist, particularly as you move North towards Atlantic Avenue. Kelso has been serving delicious food since 1969, and although it looked like a few months ago it closed for good, it recently reopened after extensive renovations. Veronica (luckily for us!) is still in charge of the kitchen, with a new business partner, and there's also a soon-to-come liquor license. Prices are still extremely competitive, with most main dishes priced at $8-10 But be warned: plates are generous, so you may want to come here with a few friends and just sample a few dishes. And don't forget to ask for their homemade pepper sauce (habanero chiles, onion, mustard seed, tumeric, and white wine vinegar), which is one of the most flavorful hot sauces I've ever had[3]! Start your meal with a carimañola, which may be the one single dish I love the most here: a kassava roll stuffed with meat and boiled eggs, then deep-fried. It's as delicious as it sounds. It's also the perfect dish you want to bring to a party, whether it's a Superbowl party, an office party, or your own dinner party. The patacones (twice-fried green plantain disks) are also a popular starter, but I find them a bit heavy. I actually prefer the yucca fries. As main dish, the arroz con pollo de la casa ($8) was served as a combination of stewed chicken and baked chicken. The pepper steak and oxtail combo ($10) is both simple and satisfying. If you prefer seafood, try the cu cu and codfish, which is prepared with cornmeal and okra ($10). The camarones calypso with coconut rice is another delicious dish that I highly recommend. At Kelso you will find delicious comfort food, simply prepared, cooked with passion, and a homey feel. Makes you wish your mom was Panamanian. ----------------------------- [1] The celebration of Panama independence is actually today, October 12 2013.

It was his birthday, so we said he could choose.  Also, we needed a quick place to eat since we had tickets to see a show.  It was an interesting experience being that my parents were two of the maybe 5 Caucasians in the restaurant. It was actually quite weird to be part of the majority. I guess I'd take that as a good sign, that people of Japanese or Asian decent had filled this restaurant.  We could only sit at the sushi bar area, that's how packed it was. My parents both got the katsu dinner, nothing was left on either plate. They loved it! My mom even mastered the art of using chopsticks! (Finally!). I of course, went with my typical mean of sashimi, plus a glass of soju. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to try authentic Japanese food. I thought it was great! It also seemed that everyone in the restaurant was extremely satisfied. Note that this restaurant had very reasonable prices. It was as if the restaurant wasn't even located in the city, that's how ""normal"" prices were! With that, I'd say, ""college kids, take advantage of this restaurant!""

She just split the check 3 ways because there were three cards.  Upon realizing her mistake, she cancelled it out, and swiped our cards again--without telling us.  So, we had transactions for nearly $100 instead of the $50 of our individual meal + drinks.  And it took nearly a WEEK for that charge to be reimbursed.   The food/service otherwise:  I came here for a dinner with four friends.  We came straight after work--6:30--so we had no problem getting a table.  The place is quite small, and it is crammed with tables.  We were so close to the couple on a date next to us, that the couple just jumped in our conversation.   The drinks were OK, but some of the prices seemed a little off for the ""casualness"" of the place.  For example, $10 for a smallish container of guacamole.  Plus, they don't give you enough chips... and then they charge you EXTRA for chips (not to mention a server spilled water all over us--and our chips.  Making some of the chips soggy...)

I prefer to keep the good restaurants to myself as secret little gems in order to avoid the  incessant overcrowding/tourist attraction that has come to ruin so many great nyc establishments. HOWEVER, I LITERALLY (and I mean literally) created a Yelp account just to speak about La Sirene because it really is the most unbelievable restaurant in nyc. The food is mind blowing and you will come to agree. The place is great- very cute (as previously stated only seats 25) so very small and intimate and one of the reasons (I believe) that the quality of the food is so impeccable. This place isn't your ""mass producing"" theatre-district restaurant. This is only for those who know damn good French cuisine. We started with the mussels in mustard sauce and all I can say is AMAZING. The only thing that I could say while eating these was ""omg, omg, omg."" Words cannot even describe how damn good these mussels are.. the broth is incredible. I wanted to drink it after I was done. Goat cheese came next (also unbelievable beyond words). Creamy and warm with some mango to add a subtle sweet flavor. AND the french onion soup.. soooo good. The filet mignon here is the standout star. Hanger steak also unbelievable. And for dessert the profiterolles- a MUST. LOVE LOVE LOVE the menu and its awesome unapologetic  side notes (ie: for the profiterolles it is noted that this is not ""Hershey's"" and that if you don't like it, don't try it!! I feel like a review just doesn't do this place justice. You need to just go and try the food. It is BYOB and cash only, so be aware of that before you go. But the service is outstanding (waitstaff unbelievably friendly and definitely aiming to please) and the atmosphere quaint and romantic.

I had never heard of this place until my trip to NY City last week. I have too agree with many of the other people here who say that this place is OVERRATED. It is not overrated due to price though, I am from SF and am very used to overpriced food, but rather due to how good the food is. We started with 3 orders of deviled eggs, and a plate of Bouchot Mussels with Tomato & Herbs. The eggs were not as good as what you can make at home, even if you have never made them. They had no flavor and tasted like parsley or whatever they had sprinkled on them. There were like 2 little millimeter chunks of bacon on each half egg. The muscles were in a good sauce and tasted great. For dinner I got the burger, my girlfriend and her sister both got the Crispy Pork Belly in Broth with Fall Vegetables & Pumpkin Fritters. The burger was cooked the way I asked, but it is no better than what you will get at burger bar or jenny's giant burger. The fries looked cool, but were hella oily and super salty, which I did not appreciate. I tried some of their pork belly, which was not crispy at all; it was actually very soggy and chewy. The portion size of the crispy pork belly is a joke. Look at all of the pictures of the burger posted here now imagine that burger cut into fourths, and that is the portion size of the pork belly.

So, why do I love Balthazar despite the fact that it falls into all three categories?  Because the food is so damn good that I am willing to forego reason and break all the rules.   My last brunch at Balthazar included sharing many items on the menu.  The puff pastry filled with scrambled eggs, asparagus, and wild mushrooms?  Amazing.  The puff pastry, which I don't always like, was perfectly flaky and buttery moist at the same time.  I split the roasted pepper and carmelized onion quiche with gruyere cheese was so rich and decadent that splitting it gives you just the perfect amount of it without feeling too full from its richness.  And, of course, my favorite thing in the whole world....  They have an amazing bread basket!!  Since I am always carbo loading (for no particular reason), I am a sucker for a good bread basket and this one is divine.  I know people who love the seafood tower there but anyone who knows me knows I can't go there but for those who can, it's supposed to be phenomenal.  The mimosas are tasty but the coffee is delicious.  Personally, I go for both.  : )   And despite the fact that it has this reputation and has a snobby air about it, the waitstaff is anything but.  The service is friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable.  Breakfast at Balthazar can be a little expensive but some things are fairly reasonable.  Regardless, it's worth it.   So, bring on the wait, bring on the snobby patrons, bring on the celebs or at least the celeb hunters, just make sure you bring on that bread basket, puff pastry, and quiche along with it and I'll suffer through the rest."

He was friendly, happy and accomodating. My only complaint about this place (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), was our waitress. When I asked questions about the food, she repeated herself instead of explaining, in a belittling way. She said to me, I'm not understanding (with a dry and questioning tone)...

Anywho, speaking only of ambiance, I must say the hustle and bustle of the place does remind me of the random french cafe in paris.  It really is adorable.   Now...the food.  We started off with an appetizer sized portion of their scallop risotto topped with pancetta.  I cannot even begin to describe the tingly feeling that crept down my spine after the first bite.  We both realized that we should have ordered the entree--as our appetizer.  Yes, we're gluttons.  The risotto was perfectly creamy and the scallps were huge---and seared on both sides.  Absolutely phenomenal! We were now on a scallop high.  We couldn't resist and ordered raw scallops on the shell.  It was our first time having scallops raw, and again, we began to regret ordering only 6 and not 12.   Our entrees finally came, and we were oh-so-anxious to eat.  He ordered the steak and pomme frites.  We weren't too fond of the bernaise sauce (we're purists--salt and pepper will do just fine), but the steak was cooked perfectly.  The cut (can't remember what it was) delicious--chewy and with just the right amount of fat.  I ordered the special of the night, the seafood platter.  It was huge.  Huge prawns, scallops, sole, and a filet of their fish of the day, all on top of a bed of sauerkraut.  It was most definately good, but not as good as the scallop risotto.   We finished off the night with a fresh fruit tart with their homemade vanilla. It was delicious...so delicous that we ordered another dessert.   Every other dessert coming out of the kitchen were the profiteroles stuffed with their homemade vanilla, with chocolate sauce.  So we felt the need to try it.  Ehhh...the puff pastry was on rather dry and i found the chocolate sauce overwhelming.  Kinda a let down.   We were so stuffed we couldn't walk for a good 30 minutes.  Overall, it was a spectacular meal.

So, what better remedy to get yourself back on your feet than eat some chicken katsu! Actually, I really wanted Japanese food so I could eat rice and have some miso soup. Little did I know that we would find an actual Katsu place! FOOD - 5 Stars: We ordered the lunch special: - Chicken Katsu (yelp.com/biz_photos/kats): The chicken was very delicious: moist, tender, juicy, and a crispy breading, which was not too oily. It definitely exceeded my chicken katsu expectations. - Miso Soup (yelp.com/biz_photos/kats): The soup was really good. Very homey and tasty. Perfect for hitting my hunger spot. - Potato Salad (yelp.com/biz_photos/kats): The potato salad wasn't what I was expecting and I mean that in a good way. It was not only potato salad, but also a bunch of salad. Haha. I'm accustomed to just getting potato... so this was a nice surprise and very delicious. Oh and you can see on the side are the sesame seeds that they provide so you can pulverize them and put them on your salad. - Katsu sauce and salad dressing (yelp.com/biz_photos/kats): The salad dressing is one of the best that I've had. I could have drank the entire bottle. It was so good.... I'm drooling thinking about it. The katsu sauce was really good too and made the chicken katsu jump to that next level! SERVICE - 2 Stars: The service here was pretty bad. I felt like we were rushed to order and once we ordered, we practically didn't see our waiter again. The food was delivered and he never checked on us. We had to flag him down for extra napkins and more drinks. Even getting the check was a hassle. Flagging someone down and the waiters just looked confused as if it's an extra burden to have to deal with us. We came here at lunch during a weekday so it's not like the place was that busy. Perhaps they were understaffed or it was an off day, but that's still no excuse. ATMOSPHERE - 4 Stars: This place is quite small. When you enter, it's a little weird with what they have upfront, but you go towards the back and all the seating is there. It was pretty cozy. RECOMMENDATION: Despite the poor service here, I really enjoyed my chicken katsu. I've had a lot of chicken katsu in my life and this is up there on my list. The salad dressing sauce with the cabbage was so delicious too. Everything was so good... I can't wait to come back here!"

I was not impressed with the ambience at all; I almost thought I stepped into Terikayki Boy.  My Japanese friend already warned me about this, the place is full of Indian waiters that speak a little Japanese. At first I was skeptical about the place, as always with Japanese restaurants run by non-Japanese.  I ordered the katsu curry, and my date ordered the ladies' choice.  I have to say, that was the best one I had in NYC.  The breadcrumbs were so crispy, not oil-dripping like some other places.  The pork inside was so tender and juicy, not heavy at all!  Their other dishes were only so-so, stick to the pork. I will definitely come back for the kastu alone.  Will go for the katsu-don next time, heard some good things about that too."

Lots of sausage.  Not on the menu - the in the pants kind.  When she arrived, I said she had increased the female population by 50%.  I wasn't kidding. With that aside, the place is very clean and has a nice look to it.  A long bar leads you straight into the establishment, which has a handful of table areas towards the front and some more in the back.  Since I am a guy, the number of large flatscreen TVs is what caught my eye.  They had a Real Madrid game and a Manchester City game showing on alternating screens, and I realized that many of the seats gave you a great view of both. The beers are reasonably priced and they have some for happy hour at $5 a pop.  The surprising thing was the menu - we were expecting the standard bar food selection, but Smithfield seemingly is reaching for something greater.  For example, you can't find chicken fingers on the menu, but you can find quinoa. For the record, I still have no idea what quinoa is.  Even after she explained it to me. I had the guacamole and, while I've had better (hey, some of my Latino friends make some damn good homemade guac!), this was satisfying. If I'm ever in the area and looking for a place to catch a soccer match, I'll probably head back to Smithfield."

Challah french toast is a strong dish too. On the soft-soggy spectrum, it definitely fares well. I haven't yet tried the Israeli breakfasts, but I swear I will one day -- hummus in the morning just hasn't grabbed me. The coffee is good too.

I heard the hype from my friends and fellow yelpers but read the mixed reviews. This is a place I kept putting off because I thought I knew what to expect. Well I'm sorry I waited so long to come here because I was pleasantly surprised by the food they serve at Cookshop. Before I came here for dinner, I thought to myself that this is yet another overpriced restaurant that focuses on small portions and over-presentation. Although it is pricey and the food a bit decorative, I have to say that the taste of everything really blew me away. Also, even though I am a big eater, the portions were adequate enough where I didn't have to eat off the other restaurant patrons' tables like I normally do in that type of situation. We started off with the braised pork belly with smashed potatoes from their app list and their fried chicken wings off their snack list. I can never go wrong with pork and of course it had me wanting more. Easily could have eaten three more orders of the pork belly. The meat was so tender I could almost cut it with a fork. Everything had an interesting flair to it. The wings had some sort of honey glazing on them that gave them an extra kick. The wings were not the wings that I am normally used to while sitting on the couch watching football, but they were still really tasty. For my entree I had the Virginia ham over a bed of cornbread stuffing and beans. The online menu said it would be a pork shoulder instead of the ham so I was a little skeptical. Ham is something that I wouldn't really order at a restaurant. The waiter told me that the menu changes frequently and everything is good here so I shouldn't worry. I had heard that one before and it did nothing to ease my skepticism. I took a leap of faith and ordered the ham anyways. All my worries disappeared because I was shocked at how good it was. Mixed with the cornbread stuffing gave it a nice flavor. This wasn't any ham you'd find in a ham sandwich. It was high class ham. It was as if it was crafted from the lineage of Porky Pig or Wilbur. That's some pig. My total experience here left me full and satisfied. I'm a firm believer in always having room for dessert but I was too full to press on. Your average entree here will set you back about $28, but I knew that coming in.   If I had any complaints it would be over the noise level but it was Friday night and it was packed. That's expected. It's a good thing they take reservations because  you can expect a wait if you come here on a weekend night. Getting all the way to the far west on 10th av in Chelsea isn't the most convenient by subway but this place is well worth it."

If you live in the neighborhood, I highly recommend it- I was able to enjoy my wait on the couch in my apartment, rather than on a hard bench in 100 degree weather. Lucali's obviously has a lot going for it- the fervent, cult-like following is definitely an indication. The pizza is solid, of course- the two of us had no problem putting away a whole pie. I even liked the fact that it wasn't air-conditioned- it felt like being in someone's kitchen. Be prepared, however, to drop some serious cash for a pretty basic pizza. If you get any toppings, you're going to be paying nearly $30, which I wouldn't necessarily mind if I felt the product was really something special. Of course, the pizza was delicious and fresh and crusty blah blah blah- everything you would hope and expect from a place like this, but it wasn't transcendent. It was just good. Also, the service we experienced was a bit spotty. We were seated and our server touched base, asked if we wanted any drinks, etc. and gave us a minute to discuss our order. Then she went on break. When there are only two things on the menu, it really doesn't take more than a minute to discuss what you are going to get, so we tried to get the attention of the other server, but to no avail. We were left waiting for at least 15, 20 minutes before our server returned. It was obvious that she felt bad, so she comp-ed us each a can of soda for the wait. By that point, I was so hungry that I downed the Pepsi in about 10 seconds and spent the rest of the wait for my pizza gnawing on the aluminum. When the pizza did come (we got a pie with basil, garlic, and red peppers), my ravenous self did that thing where you try to get as much of a slice into your mouth as possible and end up smearing your face with boiling hot cheese lava. Of course, none of this was really Lucali's fault, as I probably would have done that without the extra 20 minute delay as well."

We got just about every flavor and out of the 15 or so macaroons that we got there were only about 4 that we liked... :( A macaron has to have a chewy interior and a crispy outer shell and I just didn't get that consistency with the macaroons here... Even my favorite flavor the pistachio was pretty bland... The flavors here just didn't pop. For the money we paid I don't feel it was worth it... There are better macaroons in the city so unfortunately I won't be back here I would rather go to macaron cafe."

However, a ""5-minute"" wait turned into ""maybe 15 minutes"" which turned into almost an hour. I don't mind waiting (especially on a busy Saturday night) but how does a 5-minute wait turn into an hour? The Moroccan couscous was very good and the hummus was amazing - very creamy and smooth. The service was a bit inefficient, which likely contributed to the long waits people were experiencing. Cash only, which we only found out when trying to pay by credit card. This was the most annoying part - if you're cash only you need to make that more obvious than a tiny sign by the cash register! Also, what could possibly be the reason to be cash only in 2014? Very frustrating. Now that I know that, however, I would probably be back with adjusted expectations for a longer wait and a card-less payment."

It is a tiny place that can be easily missed if you have not seen the crepe displays on the outside! They advertise their usage of rice flour crepes instead of the normal flour. The menu has extensive options of both savory and sweet dessert crepes. The crepes come in cone-shaped and all you have to do is bite it! This is a great place for anyone who loves sweet but don't want to feel guilty over your dessert! This is the best healthy alternative for you! I ordered the Harajuku Fruit Cocktail Crepe - it was the fruitiest crepe of all! It has fruits like strawberries, raspberries, blue berries, bananas, mango, almond, and some cream. It was a a delightful and light treat I must taste! The cream was very light and not overwhelming. The fruits were evenly spread out throughout the crepe and the flavor was very well blended together creating the fruitiest crepe of all! I would recommend this to starters. The crepe part of it was warm, soft, and a little crispy at the corners. The crepe flour itself was very light and delicious! I have also tried the Lychee Valentine which has lychees, rose petals, raspberries, rose flavored cream, and almonds. The name of this crepe sounds so romantic and the look of the crepe is just so beautiful! However, I did think that this crepe was very bland tasting. I was tasting the can lychee here and then the edible rose petals here... and then raspberries over there. I feel like the flavor of this crepe was not well put together. I can understand since can lychees aren't fresh and it's typically really hard to bring out the lychee flavor. My friends tried the Azuki Berries which has strawberries, matcha green tea ice cream, and chocolate pocky sticks. I took one bite, it was very tasty too! The crepes can be a mess to eat especially you're walking in the street. They do provide utensils like spoons or forks! The line goes out the door and around sometimes during lunch and dessert hours so try to avoid those times. I would have given this spot a 5 stars despite the fact that I did not enjoy 1 item out of everything on the menu. I had to knock out 1 star for customer service of one younger employee at the counter. I didn't appreciate the fact that very few times I have been there and with different guests are quickly brushed off just so she can get back to her conversation with coworkers as well as given that dead look to all her other customers."

Hometown BBQ is basically on the water in Red Hook, a convenient 2 or so blocks from Ikea. The space is pretty big and has tables in the front bar area and also in the back serving area. Apparently I was talking to someone else who was a regular, they have smokers in another piece of property a block or two away that handles the meat. It gave me the impression that they had a lot of room to work with but when I went there at 5 pm on a Saturday they had already run out of beef ribs and some other items on the menu, so make of that what you will. The first thing you'll notice about Hometown BBQ is that the food is expensive. Brisket checks in at $14 for a half pound. A rack of ribs checks in at $29. These are wallet busting prices. For this price the food better be damn good... and it is. The brisket is plenty good, nice smoke ring and bark (ok I'll stop) and good moist fattiness to it. The jerk baby back ribs are the highlight here. Cooked perfectly, just ripe. Tender... smokey flavor. Easily the best god damned ribs I have ever had. I don't say that lightly... I've had ribs in lots of places and they are usually mediocre in one form or another. Some aren't fresh and try to hide it with sauce. Others are smoked too long and charred to a crisp. The ribs here are tender, still a bit juicy with excellent smoked flavor. If you asked me where the best BBQ joint in NYC is, I would have to admit as of June 2014 that it's in Red Hook Brooklyn. I'm leaving one star off because the lines here are a bit ridiculous. I came in shortly before 5 pm and the place was pretty much empty with tons of tables available. It took me damn close to an hour to get to the front of the line... they need to work on that line. They got 2 people ringing up orders but the process is just slow for some reason.

We shared a roasted squash salad to start, which was so good that we left not the tiniest leaf of lettuce uneaten.  It sounds like a sweet dish, but actually, the vinaigrette was quite pleasantly savory.  I'd come back just for the salad! The nice thing about Runner & Stone being a bakery during the day is all the bread they bring you with your dinner.  The bread was all pretty good, but the butter could've used some salt or seasoning.  You'll want to get something with some extra sauce so you can put that bread to good use. I opted for the braided ricotta ravioli while the hubs got the pizzoccheri.  I liked the ravioli, which were not really braided so much as tied off at the ends like Christmas crackers.  They were beautiful, but the tomato jam seemed a bit overly sweet.  The hubs enjoyed the pizzoccheri, which was made with buckwheat noodles.  He said the noodles tasted almost like meat, meaning it as a compliment. In order to round out the romantic dinner experience, we decided to share a banana split.  It included barley malt ice cream, marshmallow sauce, and, most intriguingly, crunchy bits of caramelized bread!  It may sound strange, but it was delicious and a perfect way to end the night.  It's a bit shmancy for an everyday dinner, but Runner & Stone is an impressive date spot."

We started with the brussel sprouts (and if you are one of those people who's childhood ruined these delicious veggies for give it another chance, I promise you won't be disappointed), grilled pita with three dips: Roasted Beet Skordalia, Hummus and Romesco, (we had to keep asking for pita bread), Lamb Kefteddes, and the Patatas Bravas. We were loving the tapas theme we had started so we ordered more Patatas Bravas, mushrooms, and some items off of the daily menu (which i can't remember right now, but trust me it was delicious. If you need another reason to check this place out we ordered tons of drinks and food for 4 hungry people and it came out to less then $150. So check it out. Buen Provecho!"

(Oops, I didn't meant to post it yet... anyways) I had the prix fix dinner on Tuesday night... my friend Angie K. came to visit, and for once she didn't show up at 11pm. We could eat somewhere that wasn't a diner. I started with the turnip soup with tapioca. It was nice, but I think the salad would've suited me better. But the rock shrimp and Parmesan cheese risotto was WONDERFUL. It was thick and creamy, and shrimp was cooked well - very tender. The dessert, an apple steam cake, was delicious as well, on its corncake pedestal. Brunches are reasonably priced for an entree and (non-alcoholic) beverage, but the sides are small. I can't complain too much, though, even when there's a wait. This place is just steps away from where I live."

Doorman was a gentleman and kept letting us know there was a free coat check. The lady at the coat check was pretty courteous to us and smiled the whole time. Right when you walk in, you see a giant square bar in the middle and thin ledges on the side. In the back there is the small dance floor and the tables for reservation on both sides. There are probably 4 square tables on each side. At first it was pretty quiet and seemed like everyone in the bar was just concentrated on conversations with their date or the food they ordered. But then we started dancing without anything in us because the hip hop music was great - a sign of a good DJ. Drinks were decently priced - around 7 bucks for a jack and coke (I might be wrong because hey I wasn't ordering them). We didn't get any food but it was a plus to have it available to us whenever we wanted it. Around 11, the tables started freeing up and we just took them over without any hassle. I also felt that the crowd was just friendly and social in general. Random people from other groups kept coming up to our party and chatting with us. The only blech part was when this guy butt in front of us in a line for the bathroom (2 unisex bathrooms) and we started arguing with him. But then again I had fun doing that haha.

I'm vegetarian and the veggie burrito is always delicious and you can just taste how incredibly fresh the vegetables are. I'm sure other vegetarians know that not all veggie burritos are created equal, sometimes it's just all rice and beans with a few measly pieces of oily or undercooked zucchini, an afterthought on a mostly carnivore centric menu... not the case at De Mole. It's fresh, tasty and not at all oily. For the vegans you can substitute for vegan cheese and vegan sour cream. They also have a lot of other vegetarian and vegan options, but I'm a creature of habit and I always get my favorite. The Guacamole is delicious and the reasonable portion comes with a mild, creamy tomato dipping salsa and somehow never enough chips. The food isn't super spicy but they always ask how you would like it prepared and they do have homemade sauces to add to your taste. The prices are reasonable and it's probably my favorite restaurant in Sunnyside because it's so consistently fresh and I always leave full and satisfied. The only reason I'm taking off a star is that they do not serve hard liquor... so no margaritas. They do have a full selection of reasonably priced beer, wine and even sangria. They also have lemonade if you want that citrus taste but it would be nice if they had the option."

Best idea we've ever had. This was months ago and I can still taste the sharpness of the rhubarb tart paired with the creme fraiche ice cream. Really beautiful and well balanced. We got the other seasonal tart as well which, again, did not disappoint. For drinks I had a citron presse, which is the french version of lemonade. It comes with containers of lemon juice and water so you can make it as tart or not, to your liking. My friend had never had one and ordered one for himself immediately. I came here a few weeks ago for lunch, and was underwhelmed. The ravioli were undersalted and bland and the french onion soup tasted like the one I've made at home. Really not worth what I paid. Because I was so disappointed, I ordered a dessert to make up for it and boy did it. the  pot de creme is gorgeous. Velvety, deep, rich chocolate. Absolutely everything you want from a pot de creme. The portion was huge and I was so sad to have to leave some of it, but I was just too stuffed. Definitely worth sharing. The service was wonderful. Very attentive, but not overwhelming.

My eggs were unusually small and would have been better with some Moroccan seasoning or paprika for colour instead of plain old pepper. The labneh was great - probably the best part of the dish actually, but not enough to carry the rest of it unfortunately. I had a latte too and that was watery - nothing to write home about. A good barista would have ensured the milk was creamy. Presentation wise - not the most visually striking - I've seen Middle Eastern done much better for the same price or less. One of the best examples I can think of is a restaurant in Melbourne called Bayte bayte.com.au who really exemplify modern Middle Eastern cuisine.

I discovered later that the cassoulet is placed in the tiny pot first and then re-heated in the oven at the end of the bar. Also, cassoulet in France counts more beans than just the two in mine... :)  Anyway, the bartender recommended the atypical Cabernet Franc from the Loire-region, which was excellent, and apparently one of the least expensive wines by the glass on their menu.

I was told by my ever knowledgeable boyfriend that the place used to be a candy store and it closed. The owner bought the place and didn't want to see the candy store become a McWhatever. That made me like the place even more. I really enjoyed having pizza here, and recommend it to anyone in the mood for some GOOD, AUTHENTIC pizza.

Now that we've established this, the only thing that really discolored our experience was the inefficient reservation system. I picked Luzzo for dinner on Sunday night because they're one of the few craft pizza places that take reservations. These were surprisingly easy to make over the phone, same day, and a breeze to change to a half hour later when I called back. We walked in at 7 (rez time) and not seated until about 7:25. We watched several other parties, some of whom looked like walk-ins, move in ahead of us while we stood in the cramped little foyer/bar area (whose seats were occupied). The hostess apologized and said there was nothing she could do--there were several parties lingering. And, in fairness, she immediately offered us 3 glasses of prosecco, on the house, which was a stand-up move. So the hostess is great. I take issue with Luzzo having a reservation system in the first place. I bet this happens more often than you would think, and creates false expectations. It's a popular place, so maybe moving to a no-rez policy would make everyone's lives easier. Once we were seated, all was good. A hip bearded waiter who sounded Italiano took care of us. We started with some marinated artichokes (OK but a little out-of-the-can tasting). The bottle of Pino Nero was light-bodied and smooth, going down easy: if you like something with more tannins, stick with the chiantis/Sangiovese. They also brought over some tasty bread, though no olive oil. There was much rejoicing when the pizza arrived (one of the orders was wrong, but quickly rectified). We had the mushroom pie, the bufala, and for me, the Michele (mushrooms, prosciutto, mozzarella, and truffle pate, sans tomato sauce). All amazing, and I had a few slices for lunch today. Prices are definitely lofty, even on the ""small"" 12"" pies, but quality comes at a cost. So far I love everything Michele Luliano does with food. Luzzo's and Da Mikele are maybe the best pie factories in the city. Despite hiccups with the reservations, I ladle praise with pleasure."

Positives: Delicious hummus with just the right balance of flavors, fantastic grape leaves, and phenomenal falafel sandwiches. Negatives: The filo in the spinach pie is always soggy, and the lamb shawarma is very dry. That said,  when you're getting a falafel sandwich with a side of hummus and grape leaves for $6.00, who really cares about the quality? The food is literally ready in under a minute, it's open late, and it has two great locations. A side note: do yourself a favor and test their hot sauce BEFORE you put it on your sandwich. I think it's the hottest sauce I've ever had in my entire life, and it can truly ruin a sandwich if you're not very VERY careful with it. The sauce is also big on spice and low on flavor, so it's not for everyone."

When we finally were seated at our tables, we noticed that everybody was super close.  Being that I'm from San Francisco, I'm use to this.  You can pretty much hear the conversation of your neighbors but I didn't mind.  I was just ready to get my eat on. I had the Bouillabaisse (special of the day for Friday) which was a soup of all kinds of seafood.  Clams, crabs, shrimp, lobster, fish - you name the seafood and it was in that soup!  I can't even begin to explain how delicious the broth was.  It was this orange broth that went so well with the seafood.  I never had anything like it before and loved it!  I wanted to pick up my bowl and drink the soup. They boy had the special NY steak with crusted pepper.  Tasting it I wasn't too much of a fan of it but he loved it.  He loved the pepper flavor and so that suited him perfectly. Last came dessert which of course was creme brulee.  The creme brulee came with two little cookies that was equally delicious.  Perfect ending to a perfect meal.

The restaurant itself is off the beaten path (which I kind of like) hidden away on Jones. The seating is typical of New York restaurants unless you get a nice booth. I love the clean wooden floor and orange color which give the place a warm feeling in combination with old classics playing on the speakers. This could be a scene in a Nora Ephron classic. The most important part is the food. He offers a tasting menu that I'm going to come back and try eventually but I don't know why the vegetarian one is promoted. I guess It's the area served. The duck meatballs are good. It's truth. Swirl the cute little quail egg yolk over it and get a little saucy and your taste buds will be dancing a jig. The oysters are fresh on the half shell. The farro risotto is delicious, creamy but not too rich. I had the roasted duck and I've never had it this way but I went with the recommended 'medium rare'. Sounds strange no? It was delicious and not in the gross way that my friends hangar steak was rare. Did I mention I tried that bloody steak and it was also delicious in a classic, and it's not really just fresh off a cow, way?? My companion #3 enjoyed the fish dish. I'm not sure what it was but it was served almost Asian style with pickled vegetable things. I wasn't a fan of either of the fish dishes I've had here. We also sampled some cheese. The sheep selection is good, a little tangy like I like my sheep. They have a decent delicious selection served with bread. The server also mentioned that Harold Deiterle is known for his duck preparations... Stick to what you know right?"

I was craving for Japanese curry and Katsuhama satisfied it!  Portion is large.   Happy to see the they can refill the cabbage salad which I did since it balances the spicy curry sauce. Husband got the pork Katsu which was good. The price is a bit more than other joints but they know what they are doing.

After watching this place on food network and reading all the comments I was def excited to drive an hour and half to try this place out only to be let down. I showed up at 830pm thinking there was gonna be a line down the block and to my surprise there wasnt. I understand if I show up at 930 or 945, then I would expect to be turned away. But even when I was turned away seemed like a group of 4 girls got in with a reservation. Really? It says no reservation accepted on their web page. But thats besides the point. I cant rate the food, but I can write they turned away a potential loyal customer..I guess thats why they charge 24 dollars for a plan large pie, so they can pick and choose who they serve or who they tell no too. Im sure their pizza would have been fantastic...but now Ill never know because I will never attempt to go there again. When your as 'famous"" as Lucali, I guess making  more customers was def not on their menu."

Put down your name and party size - they'll text you with 5-10 minute grace period before your table is ready. 2) If you're with friends, head next door to E's bar. If you're on a date, go over to Fred's across the street. Grab a drink during your inevitable time spent waiting. 3) Get the text and head back to Jacob's. Be seated in a cozy, impeccably-decorated atmosphere. Marvel at the perfectly executed decor where craftsmen-style meets industrial warmth. Also, maybe go downstairs to the bathroom to wash your hands and wonder how they even make a joint bathroom space an inviting place to be. 4) ORDER THE APPLE PIE MOONSHINE. Just do it. I promise 5) Order the fried chicken or the shrimp bacon grits. Don't forget about the pickles, naturally. And if you're a deviled eggs person, definitely take advantage of those. It's hard to go wrong with the menu selection but I will say this: order the southern food. Stick to the basics. I'm sure everything is good at Jacob's, but their specalties are the BEST.

We ordered ROASTED CHICKEN BREAST,HOMEMADE SHRIMP LINGUINE and PAN-ROASTED ORGANIC SALMON. The first two dishes were okay. Nothing special, nothing great. But, the the Salmon dish had two cubes of some meat(may be smoked bacon or ham) mixed with brussels sprouts, toasted pecans and roasted apples, so we called the waiter and told him the same, he wouldn't agree and insist that it's only the fruit. Then the manager comes, explains it wasn't other meat at all and it could be a harder part of salmon itself, which I completely disagree. However, got the dish replaced with a fresh one.

The servers were very nice and quick! They get A+s. The only thing that I should account for is the fact that we arrived before the dinner rush so that may be why we were treated so well...but maybe not! :) We went during Brooklyn restaurant week so we got quite the deal! We got 2 appetizers, 1 main course, and 1 dessert off their regular menu for $38 before tax and tip! The portions were decent! Decent enough that I was full when I finished with the meal. But, I have to account for the fact that we did go to a bar 1 hour before and I ate lunch 3 hours before dinner and they give complimentary bread before your actual meal. Their shrimp appetizer (Kadaif wrapped shrimp) was AMAZING. It had an awesome crunch on the outside and a moist, juicy tender core. A shrimp cooked to perfection. To bring the dish together it was placed in this delicious green sauce. The sauce was so good, I even used it to dip bread in. If I ever go back for restaurant week, I would just get 2 shrimp appetizers instead of 2 different appetizers. My other appetizer was hummus and bread which was also very good but nothing extraordinary. The Zatar bread was delicious; the flavors were so strong and made the bread so tasty. The meatballs were a little too sweet for my liking. Now onto the main course, I got the ""Short ribs stew"" which seemed like mashed potatoes and beef stew. It was pretty good except that the beef was NOT tender. Boo. But the sauce/flavor and mashed potatoes made the dish yummy. Then the dessert was very good. Pannacotta! It's like if pudding and flan had a baby. It's like a very thick custard. I wouldn't have known what it was if it wasn't for a friend introducing it earlier, so I decided to give it a shot here and I liked it!

Ever. *** In response to John R. *** Only someone who has something ridiculously absurd to say would create a Yelp account to try and defend the honor of an experience they did not have. How would you know I got an extra ranch for free? It was not told to me and wasn't spoken of, how could you have witnessed this unless the waitress I'm speaking of told you or announced this after I left? seems a bit sketchy to me. Either way, I think your attempt to belittle MY experience speaks loud enough on its own. I never claimed to be friends with the owner, I stated I knew him and have spoken with him several times, being as it is a small restaurant. Please keep your comments to yourself. :) As I'm writing this review I'm standing in Ox Cart waiting to pick up my order that I called in for takeout, watching the waitress (Dulce/Dulcy was the name she gave me) that just tried to ""teach me a lesson"" speak to her fellow employee behind the bar and the cooks in the back about how how ""rude"" I am. Let's make one thing clear - I've been coming to Ox Cart for over two years and I used to LOVE the place but recently due to extremely poor customer service I have cut back. Tonight was my last night ever ordering or stepping foot inside. I ordered their fried pickles and a side of fries. The fried pickles come with a side of ranch sauce and every time I have ordered it they always give you very little, so I requested two sides of the ranch. When I came in, I was handed the bill and I saw I was being charged $1 extra for the ranch. Now, I understand some places charge you for extra sauce, in this case I know that the Chef (David) makes everything from scratch, but if you're going to make everything from scratch and not have an option for something you did not make from scratch (such as ranch, mustard, etc) then you can't charge people $1 extra when the sauce comes with the food item and it's being shared! That's ridiculous. (This has also happened before at brunch when I ordered their pancake which does not come with maple syrup, when I asked for it I was charged a $1 extra, but at least I was made aware of it before hand considering it does NOT come with the pancake.) So when I looked at the bill, I asked the waitress why I was being charged for ranch when it comes with the fried pickles. She looked at me and said ""you asked for extra."" So I simply stated ""just take it off the bill then, I'm not paying extra for something that comes with the meal."" Immediately after I said that, she got defensive and loudly for everyone to hear stated ""You don't need to be rude to me, I'm doing my job, if you want to talk to a manager you can speak to them, they're here now."" ... why would I need to speak with a manager? why couldn't this waitress just take it off my bill, I wasn't asking to get her fired because I thought she was trying to pull one over on me.. I didn't want to pay $1 extra, that's it. Clearly this woman has no hospitality training because in the restaurant/bar industry (which I have been in for over 8 years) the last thing you want to resort to is getting management involved, unless there is really something you cannot handle. Anyway, I laughed it off because when I told her if I needed to speak to someone I would speak directly with David who is the chef and owner, she walked away frustrated and grabbed the money out of my hand. I told her to keep the 10¢ change, but instead she threw two nickels in my takeout bag instead of handing it back to me - pretty pathetic. Needless to say, I will not be back. Ever. Ox Cart needs to educate their servers on hospitality and proper etiquette and chill out on the up charges for sauce on the side. Too bad management doesn't read their yelp reviews because if they did, customer service would be different. I'm one of many many people who have reviewed that have commented on how poor it is."

While the food was good, the service was inexcusably poor for a restaurant at this price point. I had been looking forward to this dinner with my boyfriend for weeks. We rarely go out to eat, and Scarpetta was a real splurge for us. When we sat down, we asked for the vegetarian menus and explicitly asked for the vegetarian bread, since we knew that the bread usually contains meat. The waiter then asked for our drink orders, and as soon as we said we'd be sticking with tap water and not ordering alcohol, he was clearly disappointed. We ordered our appetizers (mushroom polenta and mozzarella in carrozza) and entrees (spaghetti and gnocchetti), and our bread and appetizers came soon after. We verified with the person who brought our food that it was the vegetarian bread, and we enjoyed the bread and our apps. Our waiter never came by to ask us how our food was. While we waited for our entrees, our waiter asked if we'd like more bread, and we said sure. Our entrees arrived, and we began to eat them when the bread arrived. I bit into a piece of the bread, tasted meat, and spit it out on my plate. I called over the waiter to tell him, and he gave a quick and insincere ""oh... sorry"" and replaced my plate and fork. He left the meat bread on the table and disappeared again. By now, I was upset that I had eaten meat, and I had pretty much lost my appetite. Our waiter did not notice and did not come back to the table at all, despite the fact that I had stopped eating my entree. About 15 minutes later, we called him over to tell him we were done and to express how disappointed we were, and he sent over a manager. I hate to get so worked up about an honest mistake, but I specifically chose this restaurant for its vegetarian menu, and I would expect more from such an expensive place. I was especially disappointed that our waiter completely brushed off the mistake, not even bothering to give a sincere apology, let alone make up for it in any way. The manager came over and said he would comp the half-eaten entrees and only charge us for the appetizers, so I gave him my credit card so we could just get out of there. Another manager came back a few minutes later and said they'd comp the whole thing. I appreciate that they didn't charge us, but I am incredibly disappointed that our service was so poor and that we did not get to experience the full meal and dessert that we had been so excited to have. I must have looked at the menu online at least 5 times in the past couple of weeks because I was looking forward to the experience so much. I would think that a restaurant that offers a separate vegetarian menu would be more careful about serving their vegetarian customers meat, but after this experience and reading other people's experiences on Yelp (there's another post from 12/24/14 that also complains about being served the meat bread despite asking for a vegetarian menu), it is clear that they don't. While I'm sure serving me meat was an honest mistake, it was careless. I believe our waiter was careless and inattentive because he felt we weren't worth his time since we didn't order drinks or meat entrees, and this is really unacceptable for such an expensive restaurant."

My first course was the Trofie Nero (ligurian crustacean ragu, seppia, scallops, spiced mollica), or more commonly known as squid ink pasta. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it's possibly one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had! The pasta was cooked perfectly al dante, and I felt like my mouth was swimming in the ocean with every bite of scallop and squid. The olive-oil based sauce was also extremely delicious without being overpowering. I could have enjoyed a bigger portion of this meal and still be extremely satisfied! The main entree was Insalata di Astice, or butter-poached nova scotia lobster with sunchokes, pine nuts, golden raisins, and delicious truffle vinaigrette.

Pretty decent atmosphere, not uncomfortably crowded, but no real music. A laid back atmosphere to down a few before heading somewhere else. Or so I thought. Why the one star? Simply put, the service was god awful. But service usually stinks in a crowded bar on a Friday night, you say? Not like this. Seriously, though. I've been in crowded bars before, and most bartenders have enough tact to say something along the lines of ""I'll be with you in a second"", ""Just a sec"", or even a simple hand gesture to indicate that your presence has been acknowledged. Apparently that's too much to ask at this place. After being rudely told to ""Hold up"" numerous times, and after being called ""bossy"" for having the audacity to request eight shots of a ridiculously easy-to-make SoCo and Lime (which they managed to butcher anyway), I decided to leave a tip that I felt was pretty much commensurate with the service I received from the two bartenders. I, of course, was called out for leaving such a ""low"" tip (even though it was more than 10%). I'd call that VERY geneous, all things considered. I walked out of the bar with a friend, and one of the busty gargolyes actually FOLLOWED ME OUTSIDE to tell me that I'm no longer welcome at the bar. Heh. I don't think they were referring to me, everyone. According to the bartenders, NO ONE is ever welcome here. Stay. Away."

The New Zealand duck breast was thickly sliced and meaty like steak.  The skin had just the right touch of fat.

We also ordered the Greek salad. Our server warned us the large was a huge portion so we got the small and it was still a lot for the 3 of us since we got two appetizers and two main courses. The Kyclades special we shared amongst ourselves was fresh and yummy but I would stick with the more simple dishes like the octopus or the sea bass and pair it with some sides and a salad. I loved the freshness of the food and how simple it was made. I definitely will be back anytime I crave seafood."

The mains of gnocchi and salmon were just okay as well.  The gnocchi was not as 'melt in your mouth' as we've had in many local restaurants and the base of this sauce was very much like that of the veal - sweet and unsubstantial.  I had the salmon which was cooked nicely, but the side of string beans were drenched in the olive oil 'sauce' that accompanied it - a bit much.   The kicker for us was that we ordered another round of drinks between apps/mains and they never came.  Our waitress even came back after ten minutes of taking this drink order, still before we received our mains, to tell us the drinks would be right out.  We proceeded to eat our entire meal sans drinks.  She finally came with the tray of our drinks (wine and an open beer bottle) and I kindly gave her the ""I don't think we need those anymore"" line.  The worst part was, she didn't apologize and leave the drinks with us at no charge, she literally said ""oh I'm sorry"" and took them back to .... the drain???  I'm not sure I know of a waiter or waitress who wouldn't just give someone the drinks they already poured and will now be wasted after waiting for them for 30 minutes.  Huge serving faux pas.

Just because you're behind the machine doesn't mean you can't at least say hello or acknowledge the presence of the customer.  This doesn't speak for everybody, there are some really great people there too. Second with all the new options in our own amazing city, even borough, why does such a establishment with local and sustainable focus still get their coffee shipped out from the west coast? Maybe the FedEx truck gives it that extra special flavor? One of the commenters below even proclaimed it's like SF in Brooklyn. As a customer living in Brooklyn and not a SF tourist, that's not a positive win for me. Will I keep getting my morning coffee here? Given it's close proximity to my studio, mostly yes.

I got one of there savory salad crepes but I forget the name of it, I think it might be new or either one of there specials. But anyways, the crepe was very flavorless and it had tomatoes, avocado, basil leaves, spicy mayo sauce and pork. I think the pork might have been bacon but they didn't use a frying pan to make it crispy,  I think instead they just sauteed it and the pieces of pork were very fatty. I thought the prices were kinda high for what your getting because mine was a little over 10 dollars and it can't even compare to the size and the similar price of a burrito from Chipotle.

Good thing there was nonstop jams of hip hop and 3 screens playing sports, miscellaneous videos, and a really dated movie to prevent any potential awkwardness. The food is average. It's as if you tried to cook at home (assuming you're a mediocre cook), and it turned out pretty good. Buddha Beer - the bartender was right. There isn't much taste. It's like a watery Coors light. Kimchi steamed dumplings - they tried with the bamboo steamer and putting it on top of napa cabbage. The skin was nice and thin but really, it tasted like a good freezer dumpling from a Korean supermarket. There wasn't much kimchi taste either. Pork buns - I was honestly expecting pork belly. Instead, I got huge wads of lettuce and stringy kinda dry pork. The taste was there- the execution was bad. Chicken don - This had the potential to be good. The chicken was moist enough but then they bombed it with spicy mayo. SO. SPICY. I would come back here to hang out at the bar and have drinks, but not for the food.

This was actually suggested by someone when I was looking for new places to eat before my trip. Eight Turn Crepe is in the same block as Rice to Riches and Lombardi's Pizza. So even if I didn't hear about it, I would've easily spotted it since it's right by the 6 train and on the way to Rice Riches. So the dilemma was, how do we fit all that food that these three places are all in the same block? That's what your second stomach is for... for desserts. WHAT WE ORDERED: *Azuki Berries Crepe: The main reason why we picked this: it came with matcha gelato! If there's anything green tea on the menu, that's most likely what I would be ordering 99% of the time. The crepe came with strawberries, azuki beans, whipped yogurt, matcha custard creme, slivered almonds, and pocky sticks. The presentation is obviously super kawaii. It's a little bit more compact compared to the crepes that I get at Harajuku crepes in LA. The texture of the crepe also kinda threw me off a little though since it wasn't the usual smooth crepe texture since it's a rice crepe. Nonetheless, it was delicious! I liked the matcha custard creme with the azuki beans. They also neatly roll the crepe and put it in a paper pouch, so eating it on the go is not such a hot mess. I think ice cream cones are overrated and ice cream or gelato should really be eaten in a crepe cone :D. The restaurant is super tiny. Like two bar seats, tiny. The place was empty when we went, so we were able to enjoy our crepes inside the store and people watch since you're facing Spring St. It's cute how they have ""crepes"" inside a cloche displayed in their store-front window. It kinda reminded me of Beauty and the Beast... you know when Beast had his precious rose? Another go-to dessert spot for me in New York!"

This looked more inviting than the colonial style set up in the dining room. We politely asked if the one table was reserved, which it wasn't - so, they let us sit there. They said the lounge is on a first come first serve basis. SCORE. The chairs were very comfortable but it was a little difficult to eat dinner on the small table.

The kobe beef of pork is served on a metal net over a plate that allows excess fat to drip down. It was no surprise to have each piece melt in my mouth. It's Berkshire, after all.

Now, i don't go here as often, but i was here earlier this week for a reunion dinner with high school friends. The place was pretty empty for a Tuesday night. They offer pitcher of Kirin, which is always a table pleaser. They have assorted Katsus with various types of toppings and porks. You can get the loin, tenderloin, berkshire loin, or berkshire tenderloin, and other non-pork dishes. However, they are known here for their tonkatsu so you might as well get a pork katsu. For app, my friends forced me to try a piece of the Chikuwa Nippon Age. It's pretty much a deep fried fish cake that has cheese inside. It was salty/sweet. Honestly, it wasn't my fave. I'm not a fan of cheese with Asian food. It was just weird, but it wasn't bad. I mean i can see the appeal since it is deep fried cheese....I mean i love jalapeno poppers, but this is a bit different with the fish cake. For my entree, i typically order Hire Katsu set, which is the standard katsu with tenderloin, but on tuesday i changed it up and got the miso hire katsu, which was the katsu topped with a miso glaze and scallions. The standard katsu comes with a bowl of toasted sesame seeds that you grind yourself and you pour sauce into to dip the katsu in. The miso katsu came with no dipping sauce but that is because you don't need it since you have the miso glaze. The set also comes with a miso soup and all you can eat shredded cabbage and white rice. The entree set course is pretty fililng where you probably don't need to order more rice and cabbage, especially if you're eating and drinking beer at the same time.  The tenderlion pork katsu is still pretty juicy and fatty. It is fried to perfection. Honestly, I don't think i'll ever upgrade to the berkshire pork tenderloin because I'm already very content with the standard pork tenderloin. The pork katsu is crunchy, salty, moistful goodness. Probably one of the best katsus around NYC. It's def not a healthy meal, but that's what the cabbage is for....until you pour some dressing on it.... I have to say i'm def a bigger fan of katsuhama than menchanko-tei, which are sister restaurants."

The pork was delicious, they offered all-you-can-eat cabbage like what you'd find in Japan (trust me, you'll want seconds), and the soup was a-ok.

I had my birthday dinner here recently and have heard nothing but good reviews from friends. I knew it would be good but it surpassed my expectations. As a California native, Mexican food is a sacred, treasured part of life. It isn't a traditional taco/burrito joint that I'm used to hitting up but it's amazing in it's own way. Let's start with the happy hour drinks - great, especially for the price. Get the mango marg or pineapple drink ( I forgot the name). Obviously order the guac as an ""appetizer"". For my entree I ordered the shrimp and scallops, in the life - changing hazelnut chipotle mole. The shrimp and scallops were cooked to perfection... Like buttah! Everyone at the table had to try the sauce. I also tasted the carne asada, pechuga rellena, and camarones adobadas - all Fantastic! My dish was my favorite! All meals come with beans, rice, and tortillas for the table. We also ordered the platanos fritos to share. Make sure to order extra! The crema and queso was delightful. Everyone enjoyed their meal and basically licked their plates clean! I became happier with every bite. Service was also exceptional. The servers put up with our large party and gave us a great table in the back with lots of room. The only reason I gave Fonda four stars is because of the desserts. Believe me, it was hard to exclude that last star from the review. The desserts were decent...I just love me some delish tres leches. It was good but not amazing. Surprisingly the dessert that stood out was the pudin de banana. The guava sauce was insanely tasty and quite the twist on the expected ""average"" dessert. We had a memorable experience at Fonda. We have all been talking about how great the meal was and when we plan to go back again!"

I am a big seafood lover not to mention a resident of West Village so this place is one of my frequent hangouts, obviously for the food only. Last I was there last night with a date. We had everything to share: mussels with white wine and garlic broth, delicious, for an appetizer, although mussels were quite tiny (but not over or undercooked, just right). Then we had oysters with seaweed on top (my date was ordering so I couldn't catch the name on the menu) which was even better than the mussels. Then oysters with bacon bits and a sauce with mayonnaise (would not be my first choice but I love oysters so I had a few) Afterwards my choice: fisherman's stew with tomato based broth with half lobster, oysters, clams, mussels, fish..All our orders came with garlic bread on the side which was very mushy, wet, with too much butter on top, not even OK or edible but for the fresh seafood it was tolerated. I still left happy and satisfied, yes you guessed it, because I love seafood and my date did most of the service (yes a paying customer but he was constantly trying to correct the mistakes of the waiters just to make the experience better for us/me, bringing silverware from the kitchen, napkin from the kitchen, then water from the kitchen, then cleaning up the table, etc)..

And the name is a bit apt, as it will make you fat after a bit of buddha, if you smell what I'm stepping in. It does seem, however, that Fat Buddha is more focused on the bar aspect rather than the food. For instance, they are blasting music at all hours (even if you're the only people there and you're just looking to get something to eat). And they have bottle service, which I find a bit odd in such a small joint. But I was at Fat Buddha to eat, and eat we did. Everything was quite enjoyable, although I think most of the items can be a bit better elsewhere. Korean Fried Chicken (no BonChon). Salt & Pepper Squid (no Poco). Pork Buns (no Baohaus). Bulgogi (no Don's Bogam). Dragon Fries (I've never had these anywhere else; it's fries covered in wing sauce, and served with Japanese mayo*).

THE STORY: The Little Owl is little. But the compact, 30-seat space is by no means wanting for flavor, hospitality, or style. For appetizers, the Eggplant Parm with herb marinated tomato salad hits the perfect balance of light, yet sumptuously warm flavor, while the Ricotta Cavatelli with kale pesto are rich, creamy and melty bites of comfort. My date and I told our waitress that we were splitting the appetizers, and the kitchen even split the portions for us on two plates, a special touch truly reflective of the thoughtfulness inherent in the restaurant. The entrees themselves were nearly perfectly cooked, particularly the dense Broiled Halibut resting on a bed of corn, peas, and sprouts, served with a warm pesto vinaigrette. Yet the Pork Chop with butter beans is undoubtedly the star of the menu, cut into massive, juicy portions and seasoned with a rich balance of spices that include cayenne and cumin. We finished our meal with a local cheese plate that our waitress lovingly guided us through, making sure we didn't miss out on any bite. We left full and passionately invested in the nicety of the space, because somehow between the large windows and smiling, earnest demeanor of the service, a dinner at The Little Owl feels like coming home."

Because of the decor, because of the food, because it's a total scene, and because it serves some of the freshest raw bar all around. Coming back to Balthazar, I like to reminisce the last visit - where we set, what we ate, the time & day, and how gleeful I was leaving the restaurant! The dish with most mileage on my palette is undoubtedly Le Grand (2 tiers) or Le Balthazar (3 tiers). These plates are tiers upon tiers (upon tiers) encrusted with raw oyster & shellfish like some pave jewelry. Yes, that Gout is going to sneak upon me any minute now, but I do not care - the Pouilly-Fumé has clouded my judgement. It is not a pretty sight watching me eat lobster (or crab) - I devour everything. Well, I am Russian, so of course I was taught to eat everything out frequent Soviet food shortages. Ah, Balthazar, a gift from the (French) Gods. I was lucky to lunch there last Saturday with my mother, and my good friend The Hangover. Can 2 tiers of raw shellfish cure a hangover? Possible, but it had a helping hand from the French Onion Soup. Hallelujah Krishna! My mother & I actually can devour 3 tiers, but that typically draws unpleasant stares from other tables... So we stuck to eating the 2-tier Le Grand. C'est Magnifique! By the time we finish Le Grand (within 1-2 hours) we get hungry again, and since it's time for dinner, we like to dive right into the evening menu. I recommend the Steak Tartare, Foie Gras Mousse, Grilled Octopus Salad, French Onion Soup, Duck Shepherd's Pie (One or all, in a single sitting. Depends how hungry you are!) Bon Appetit!"

However the food was simple ok. I had the jeepney burger, the balut and the fried tripe. The burger really was not anything special. I was not blown away, nor was there anything special or unique about it to really make me remember it all that much. Balut was interesting, you could clearly see where the duck was and where all the egg whites were too. The undeveloped fetus kind of tasted like liver, and the egg whites tested like......well egg whites. There was a part of the balut thought that was really hard and rubbery and was basically unedible. overall an interesting appetizer. The fried tripe was the only thing that really stood out. I've have my fair share of tripe, but never deep fried tripe. the tripe was still incredible chewy, but still soft. The frying of the tripe did pretty well to take the barnyardish smell out of it as well.

As soon as I walked by, I remembered from years back how long the lunch lines were, so I put it in the back of my mind for another day.  A week later, I had some time to kill after work before heading to an event down in Brooklyn and had a craving for anything Indian (which seems to be a pretty common craving these days; Indian food is one of the most diverse, interesting cuisines out there to me, but I digress...), so I stopped in around 6PM for a bite to eat. Lots of reviews mention the wait time here, whether it be at lunch time, dinner time, or post-drinking time; this review is not one of them.  Luckily, 6PM on a Wednesday night appears to be a rare lull where you can walk right up to the counter and order right away.  With several people waiting for their orders already, I'd say it took maybe five minutes to get my food, which seems to be best possible scenario there.  The service is extremely friendly and polite,  asking if its your first time and offering suggestions/explaining things if it is.  Good, polite service always gets points in my book. As for the food itself, I got two rolls, which I think is the perfect amount of food for your average person.  The Aloo Masala roll is very well balanced and perfectly captures a lot of the qualities in Indian food that I love - definitely five stars for this roll.  The Chicken Tikka roll was not quite as good, but still tasty enough.  While the chicken itself was well marinated and juicy, the complex flavors present in the Aloo Masala roll just weren't there.  One last note on the food - spare the extra 25 cents and get the cilantro-based chutney; it adds the perfect amount of spice and compliments the other flavors very well. If you're willing to put up with the wait or ok with waiting until a period where they're not super busy, Kati Roll is worth it."

Trattoria Trecolori is a moderately priced establishment, with excellent service, a nice atmosphere, and really good Italian cuisine. I had the Tre Funghi (Chicken Marsalla), but had them substitute spaghetti marinara for the mixed vegetables. For me, this is a real test of Italian restaurants. First of all, I'm highly critical of how a restaurant makes their marsala sauce and most places don't make it ""the right way"" by my standards. Trattoria Trecolori hit the nail right on the head... it was perfect! And, the fact that they used three different kinds of mushrooms took it to a whole new level. Secondly, most restaurants over cook their pasta, but not this one. The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente, and the marinara had a really nice flavor and texture. Then came desert. I had the Tiramisu. Trattoria Trecolori claims to make it fresh in house, and I would believe it. It was very well done and a nice presentation.

She's an expert at traveling so we immediately trusted her despite my friend who currently goes to Columbia and never heard of this place before. When we got there, the hostess told us to leave our phone number and they would call us in an hour or so because the wait was long. I was like OHMYGOD an hour, this place better be blow-your-mind good since I'm impatient when it comes to waiting for food, which turns out doesn't help when I'm in NYC. We went to the nearby CVS so I could pick up a few toiletries since I didn't bring any for my stay in NYC. We were called about 40 minutes later and led downstairs to like this really hidden basement. The atmosphere definitely caught my attention. Despite not really being able to see the surroundings since it was a bit too dark for my preference, it was definitely a great environment and I kinda liked it. The food was amazing! I never taught I would go to a place for meatballs and actually liked it. It wasn't like quite blow-my-mind good but it was by far one of the best meatballs I tried. I liked being able to choose what to go with what. I had an extreme dilemma choosing. At the end of it all, the price wasn't too bad. I imagined a place that packed and atmosphere to be a bit more pricey but it wasn't bad at all. I would say it's quite affordable. Would I return?

The space is way too bright inside. So much focus is put on illuminating the artwork that the essence of intimate dining is completely lost. Maybe having brunch there is a better option. In addition the music that they were playing was ""very"" dated and dry ... possibly a 70's station on Pandora... and not surround sound so it is heard in corners where the speakers hang. It almost felt like dinning in a lunchroom to me. The food was average. Bread was tasty, halibut ok and could have been crisper on top, dessert ok.

I ended up being extremely disappointed with the pizza. The slice I got was very soggy and the cheese was mushy. It just didn't settle right with me. I didn't even finish my $3 slice which should tell you something considering my obsession with pizza. There's literally like three stools inside so you will most likely have to take the pizza to go. I was told by several New York friends that you can't go by Yelp reviews in NYC because it's largely tourists that leave reviews and not locals. I'll have to keep this in mind if I'm back in the area."

I ordered the vegetarian option based on reviews and she ordered the prosciutto crepe. We shared the crepe suzette for dessert. I'm a crepe fan in general and I've had plenty of crepes in my time. The few points taken off for this place are the following: 1) Texture: Crepes are soft through and through. I personally prefer a thinner crepe with a bit of crispiness. 2) Flavor: Was a bit bland in general for the savory choice but the sweet crepe was great in terms of flavor- not too sweet. Overall I would recommend if you're in the area but go for the sweet ones! Pros: variety, freshness, price (dessert ones are 8-9 which isn't bad) Sweet Crepes! Cons: non-crispy fully soft crepes, savory crepes lack flavor"

I got two vegetarian rolls, I think the chana masala and mixed veggie. They tasted very similar, and the ingredients lost their individual flavors.

The place was extremely crowded, so maybe they were just working too quickly, and maybe I'd have a different impression if I hadn't gone during lunch rush.

I was lucky enough to be able to find seating.  You also end up smelling like oil/food because the ventilation doesn't seem too great in the tiny store. I opted for 1 salad crepe and 1 sweet crepe: Shrimp avocado crepe $9.50 - Shrimp was large and fresh!  Abundance of avocado present.  My only gripe is there was a little too much sauce (asian sweet chili sauce and wasabi sauce) and there was a little too much going on in terms of flavors.  The bottom of the crepe became very soggy and I had to throw it out.  Decently filling, if you're looking for a small dinner. Lychee valentine - I'm not sure if rose and lychee and raspberry goes together very well.  The rose custard wasn't rosy enough and I wish there was more lychee.  But, again, the different fruits and flavors were strange together.

Four of us came here during Dine In Brooklyn week and took advantage of the prix fixe menu. There were only three choices per course, but the limited selection was irrelevant, as every option was crazily delicious. For the first course, I chose the celery root soup: creamy and earthy and tangy, sprinkled with bits of melt-in-your mouth bleu cheese and crunchy croutons brushed with olive oil. Seriously YUMS. I ordered the sauteed mahi mahi as my main course, and was happy I did so. The fish was cooked perfectly; tender and moist inside, with a perfectly crisp sear on the outside. I'm a big fan of crunchy/crispy fish, and they've perfected the art of searing. The parsnip puree was decadent - super rich and creamy. Oh, and I can't forget the spinach... sweet, sweet garlickly wilted goodness. I took one bite of someone else's risotto dish, which was equally awesome, but I was too in love with my mahi mahi to turn on it now. When the dessert menu came around, we made sure to order one of everything, so we'd be able to sample each option. The mint chocolate chip cake was dense and (somehow) refreshing all at once. The coffee pot du creme was intensely flavored and creamier than your average custard. But my favorite was the caramelized brioche. The name pretty much says it all. A slice of brioche toast with candied caramel drizzled on top, and a healthy scoop of almond ice cream. Sweet baby Jesus, kill me now. What made the food at Rose Water taste even better is the fact that most (if not all) of their ingredients are purchased from local and regional organic farms, and their menu rotates seasonally to take advantage of what nature has to offer at that time of the year. Such sustainable and responsible methods for purchasing and serving food means a hell of a lot to me. If you're going to feel guilty about polishing off the remainder of everyone else's desserts, at least you don't have to feel guilty about where your food came from."

The menu for brunch is surprisingly limited...maybe 8 choices for brunch specials. The rest was basically lunch. One little area for brunch choices but a page and a separate menu for wines? A little much.... 3. This place is so busy that the staff really struggles to keep up. The Maitre'D basically gave tables to the people that bothered them the most and seemed harried...the wait staff forgot some orders.

Maybe i'm giving 3 stars because I didn't get the 'all you can drink for 1.5 hours' deal and didn't get loud like the other tables while I was trying to catch up with an old friend. But our waiter wasn't very polite either. Without even introducing himself or welcoming us, he immediately asked if we wanted guac on the table, as if guac was complimentary. The Yelp deal you get if you check-in (free glass of Rosarita) is only free if you get an appetizer, according to our waiter. I don't know if I believe this..he was just so rude. I got the Huevos con Nopales which is basically ""eggs poached in roasted tomato sauce with nopales, topped with queso fresco, cilantro, and crispy pasilla peppers"" according to Fonda's menu...thought I would make it easier for the readers :) I liked the dish because it was different. I never had something like it. The tomato broth was clean and the ingredients were diced up in small sizes so it was easy to eat, no slurrping needed. I probably won't get it again because it did have much substance in the dish. I dont' think a big eater will be full afterwards. I do think it's worth a try if you like to try different things. My friend got the Torta de Pollo, Ancho marinated grilled chicken served in a toasted roll with Chihuahua cheese, black beans, avocado, pickled jalapeno and a mixed green salad. I thought this was cheesier, more filling and tastier than mine. I would have given 3.5 stars just for the food, but 3 stars overall because the waiter was not that welcoming."

The extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff that made you want yo order the extensive list of specials (who needs a menu)? We ended up getting several pastas as appetizers because we wanted to try the all - amazing - and I am not s pasta fan. The complimentary bruschetta (sweet tomatoes and basil - even in the winter) - and zucchini app ghat was do good, we asked for more and practically licked the plate? the langoustines shipped from Sicily were cooked to perfection (they were super accommodating on changing the risotto to broccoli rabe cooked perfect ) - I sucked every morsel with joy.

The mozzarella from this ""home of handmade mozzarella"" wasn't that fresh to me, maybe because I went at 6pm.

We decided not to get apps and went straight for our mains. He went with the Jamaican chicken and I had the parillada (mixed grill). Mains come with rice and beans which is awesome but we both chose to also get tostones as an additional side.   My other half was a turned off by the sauce the chicken came smothered in. It did say BBQ sauce with jerk spices but I guess he had hoped for more of the jerk flavors to come through and it didn't. My mixed grill came with a small piece of skirt steak, grilled chicken breast, pork sausage, chorizo, and a blood sausage. I was happy with the steak and it was nice and tender. Chicken was chewy and dry. Sausages were fine though not great. The blood sausage had potential (from what little I sampled was flavorful) but I don't eat pigs blood so That was a pass.  I'd have to say the best part of my meal were the sides. Id probably come back for apps or get my go to chicken and rice as that has never failed in the past. Overall, if you want big portions and nice, strong flavors come here.

On the contrast to our previous experiences, the service was appalling, so much so that the waitress didn't even bother to greet us when she walked over to our table to take the order.  She literally stood next to us as if she was waiting for a cue card with her lines to appear.   We should have hightailed it out of there when we saw her sourpuss face but made the mistake of sticking around.  Their famous mussels and fries, which were plump and flavorful last time, were tiny and tasteless, and everything else we ordered tasted as if they were thawed out and microwaved.  Even the ice tea tasted like dirty dishwater, and I had to send it back for a club soda.

The pros are good happy hour specials, plenty of room, and rare crowds. The major con is that the woman who tends bar (or at least the one who was there both nights I went) is really impatient and unfriendly. The first time I went in I asked for their beer and whiskey special but (unbeknownst to me) I'd missed it by about half an hour. She very condescendingly told me it wasn't available and rolled her eyes at me. The second time she asked me what I wanted and then, when I hesitated for a split second, immediately walked away. The bar wasn't even crowded but I had to wait several minutes for her to come back. It was unnecessarily rude.

Pork Belly- Two chunks of pork belly with two baby leeks and grits underneath. The skin of the pork belly could have been crispier, but it was definitely tasty. The meat was a little on the dry side, but the jus it came with helped out. Overall, not bad. Duck Confit- A bit overdone, but still really tasty and worth ordering again.

This is definitely as quintissential a New York restaurant as there is. Rarely do places that get this much press live up to the hype but Balthazar consistently hits on all cylinders. Sure, it is overrun by tourists and constantly packed to the gills but the food, atmosphere, and service are worth walking through the crowds and  rubbing elbows (literally) with the next table. No matter which meal you go for- brunch, lunch, or dinner Balthazar will deliver a terrific experience. On my most recent visit, I arrived promptly at 6pm on a frigid Saturday night right when they opened, hoping to avoid the crowds. Obviously, to no avail. However, after a quick 10 minute wait they lodged me into one of their round corner tables off to the right which is set aside for walk ins. The food items ordered included: Butternut squash and ricotta agnolotti with pumpkin seeds and gremolata ($20)- For a French spot, they executed this pasta dish very well and made this Italian guy very happy. The agnolotti were perfectly al dente with the proper filling to pasta ratio. You could actually taste the butternut squash in the filling, which tends to get lost in other places. Pumplin seeds added a nice crunch, while the gremolata brightened it up with an herbacious flavor. Only bad thing I can say is they dont offer extra parmigiano to sprinkle on top. Most Italian restaurants do this. ALL restaurants should do this, while most do not. At $20 for 5 agnolotti the price is definitely steep. But then again, you should know this coming in. Braised short ribs with cippolini onions, carrots, and garlic mashed potatoes- This is the Saturday night special and wow is it incredible. Simple, homey, textbook French, and just what I wanted on this cold night. The fatty ribs were braised to gelatinous perfection sitting in a pool of port wine jus, surrounded by onions and carrots and garlicy whipped potatoes of my dreams. Like a pot roast elevated to the highest degree of execution. A satisfying portion too. Side of onion rings- They don't have a section for sides, but they will let you order anything listed on the menu (gotta love that service). WOW. That's all I can say. One of the best onion rings around. Absolutely wonderful- perfect batter somewhere between tempura and beer batter, crispy but no trace of grease, and the onion and batter stay together when biting into it. All you need is some ketchup. These are the side that should get all the press instead of the much talked about french fries. Profiteroles for dessert were a nice sweet ending. I'm not as enthused with their desserts as I am their food, but when you put vanilla ice cream between cream puffs and drizzle it with warm chocolate sauce I am liking it."

In every review it's 'pork buns' and 'wings', but ol' Drew went with edamame, dumplings and beef buns. The edamame was the worst I've ever had. Someone literally spit it out after a bite. They tasted old or reheated and had more of a washed out grey color instead of the typical green. We left 3 bowls of the stuff on the bar. The dumplings were bleh as well. It says 'handmade' on their website, but I would change that to 'handmade and then frozen and sold at Costco' bc these things were not good. The buns were the saving grace. While not the best in town (or the block), they were discounted for happy hour and we had no problem finishing multiple orders. Seems like if you stick to the buns and things out the fryer, you're OK here. Don't go past that. Beyond the food, FB is a great time.

We were promptly informed of the no hat policy, before even making it to our table or having time to remove our winter jackets. Tip to SoCo: let your patrons remove their winter gear if it is freezing outside before harassing them to remove their harmless knit hats. It's a silly policy to begin with. But I digress, because the hat hang-up is my only complaint of SoCo. We were seated in the rear atrium area of the restaurant, which had a nice ambiance: a long wood bench and tables, great lighting, low noise level, perfect for date conversation. Our server (I believe her name was Crystal), was sweet and attentive, and quickly delivered water and beverages. For dinner, we skipped apps since I knew mac n cheese was close in our future.

I waited for my friends to arrive at the bar and sampled a glass of the Napa Valley Cab while I waited. Little did I know, Cookshop's cocktails are some of the best I have tasted in New York. When we sat down, my friends and I ordered a sampling of cocktails from the list and they certainly did not disappoint! I had a beet martini, which didn't look too appealing initially (bright red and looked like it was going to be some God-awful sweet concoction), but when I took the first sip my teeth began to sing! One of the most innovative and addictive cocktails I have ever had. I don't know how the bartender did it, but it was pure heaven! Made with a special kind of gin that is supposedly more mild, the drink went down like water- I drank almost three of them throughout the night. If you are a beet-lover and appreciate nature's candy like I do, then this is the cocktail for you. I ordered the beet salad to start (I know, I just can't get enough of them) which was served with a thick Greek-style yogurt and fresh herbs-very tasty. I also ordered the sea bass which was also served with a curry and ginger spiced yogurt (yes, I am also a yogurt lover), and sauteed rutabagas and parsnips atop black lentils. The fish was delicious, but perhaps slightly overcooked. I tried my friend's scallops-tender, cooked perfectly, and paired with the most delicious cauliflower. Another friend ordered the spiced fries-very yummy. I didn't taste her pizza, but it looked great-melty, golden cheese with a thin crispy crust. All in all, our meal was excellent. The decor is beautiful. I have heard Cookshop does a fabulous brunch as well, but have yet to go! Definitely check out Cookshop for a great dinner-at the very least order a beet cocktail at the bar- it will not disappoint!"

However, I must address a couple of pickable bones I have with Kati Roll: - It is WAY too crowded during the lunch rush. There is very little organization for the throngs of people, leaving them to just sort of logjam in the back of the space, waiting for someone to shout out their order number. The pick-up counter is literally adjacent to the registers, so it's a non-stop cluster-f*ck of people coming and going all around one little area. I'm no restaurant designer, but I can't help thinking there's got to be a better way... - I asked for no onions in my chicken tikka rolls. I hate onions. I always have and I always will. The girl at the register looked me in the eyes and repeated after me, ""No onions."" I paid, waited (20 minutes) for my food and got back to my office to discover TA-DA!! ...Onions all over my rolls. I was able to scrape them out and the flavor was fine, but still... I asked for no onions. I checked my receipt and it said nothing about being onion-free. I guess the register girl didn't think my request was important enough to be relayed to the kitchen staff. Sigh... Anyway, my nitpicking aside, the food was truly delicious. It was VERY spicy, which I love. I'll probably come back, but I may try to hit it at a more off-peak time."

It was every bit as good as I expected (and I had high expectations). Half of us got steaks with fries and they came in this great cast iron skillets with all the delicious juices for the fries. Fantastic. Great portions. The savory crepes were good, but on the light side. And in my opinion better saved for dessert.

The large calzone is a meal for one alone. The dough for the calzone is cooked to perfection. A slight chew to the crust and does not get soggy from all of the gooey cheeses within. I don't know what combination of cheeses is but Please do tell Lucali's. The blends of cheeses they use just melt in your mouth and hit all the right notes on your taste buds. Also, get a side of tomato sauce! Take a little bit of calzone and dip it in their legit tomato sauce and it's GAME OVER, except in a good way. The tomato sauce is lightly seasoned as to keep the actual flavor of the fresh tomatoes intact. The pizza on the other hand was meh. The ingredients were fresh but personally I do not like cracker-like crusts. Also, I like basil but the huge basil leaves are a little much.

Not your typical cheese stuffed mounds of fatness, these were thin & crispy with a delicate blend of 4-cheeses. This is the type of food you dream of. The pizza, thin crust with ultra fresh ingredients, made with care on a very visible counter in the back. Lucali's is small and charming, and romantic. It's BYOB and there is a bodega on the corner with a good selection of beers & a few bottles of wine. Lucali staff will cork & provide glasses for you.

At Lucali's, we had to call almost 2 hours in advance to secure a table. When we got there, I could see why. There are only about a handful of tables inside, with the rustic and ethnic decor that identifies the authenticity of the Italian kitchen, like in Tuscany or Sicily, The brick oven pizza which was made right in front of us was amazing and worth writing home about. The ingredients were as fresh as can be, and everything was turning out so good, until it got better, and found out that it was BYOB! WOOHOO!!!

Clientele is always mixed, with ages trending a bit towards the college-recent graduate age. Also, a lot of Asians. Yup. Dance music here is pretty good, although sometimes they mix it up with some weird underground stuff that has never been heard before. However, I do enjoy that almost every time I've been here, they play ""Return of the Mack"", which is my JAM. Gotta love the 90's R&B. Drinks and food here are pretty good, my friend swears by their pork buns, which are actually are pretty good, and aren't terribly overpriced. However, I would recommend coming for happy hour to get them a bit cheaper. The wings are pretty good too, albeit a bit overpriced for just 6 wings.

Well, now having dined here, it reminded me of that scene in the movie, Chocolat, where Vianne had prepared this amazing birthday dinner feast.  I remember watching her guests as their eyes continuously rolled to the backs of their heads in utter gastronomic bliss.  That's how I felt here.  Every dish was sublime, such unique and wonderful flavors dancing on my tongue, and yes, my eyes would roll to the back of my head with each taste I took.  It was amazing, and I didn't want it to end. What was interesting to me was that I don't normally eat some of the foods that I ate.... like pork belly.  (Did you just gasp?)  No, not because I'm Jewish, but more because I don't like it.  (Okay, I heard you gasp that time.)  But I tried it because if ever I'm going to like it, it'd be here.  While I can safely say it wasn't my favorite dish, I'm still glad I tried it.  As for the list of dishes we dined on, I'll be happy to tell you what we ate, but then, the menu WHEN you decide to go will most likely be different.  It changes frequently, and quite honestly, that's a very cool thing.  To me, it speaks to the chefs' creativity and versatility.  I'm still blown away by the unique combinations of ingredients, herbs, spices, everything. The dishes are on a par with ""small plates,"" but because of the richness of each dish, you will only want small portions, and yet, you will still get full.  Three of us devoured 9 very unique dishes.  They are, in no particular order...... 1.  spicy bigeye tuna tartare, tempura japanese eggplant, kecap manis 2.  baked muenster cheese, smoked chorizo, golden apples, crostini 3.  bbq, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli 4.  sauteed broccoli rabe, portabello mushrooms, truffle toast, fried egg, aged asiago 5.  seared dayboat scallops, snap & english pea risotto, caper-tomato-lemon brown butter 6.  buffalo milk burrata cheese, piquillo pepper romescu sauce, black olive caramel, baguette 7.  Hampshire pork belly, Tippy's black lentils, brown butter apple sauce 8.  icy blue mussels, meyer lemon, sherry, cream, parsley, garlic aioli 9.  parmesan spaetzle, sherried black trumpet mushroom, artichoke alfredo Even just reading that sounds amaaaaazing.  Let me tell you, tasting it is even more so. Unfortunately, we chose to get dessert elsewhere, which, in retrospect, was a big mistake, given how wonderful the food is here.  Hindsight is amazingly always 20/20.  I knew enough to take a picture of the dessert menu because it looked great, and I wanted a photo to remind me of what we had the chance to eat...... but didn't.  Guess what..... I won't make that mistake again..... but the menu will be different by the time I return.  The good news is, though, I WILL return !!  This was one of my favorite meals EVER.  Gastronomic geniuses at work RIGHT HERE.

For my main course I had the Gnocchetti summer vegetables & truffle sauce. The pasta was perfectly cooked and had just enough salt in the sauce. For dessert I had a lemon semifreddo  with pistachios... Again perfectly balanced bites.

I like many others was excited to see a new restaurant being added to the lineup of Franklin Avenue. I entered on a Friday evening to be greeted by what may be the nicest hostess ever, told that we'd need to wait a few minutes to be seated as it was a packed rainy night (so the backyard wasn't being used). No problem, my friend and I hung out at the bar and ordered a drink before being shown to our seat. So far, so good, but that was the end of the honeymoon. Being seated is cool, unless you don't see a waitress for 20 minutes. Can I get some water maybe? Thinking that maybe it was us, we started chatting with the couple that was seated closely to us and had been waiting for 20 minutes to pay the bill. We must have been hungry or desperate or riding off the high of the bustling restaurant and great service before coming to the table. In retrospect, we should have left immediately. After having my eye contact avoided by several staff members and finally flagging down a waitress, our neighbors were able to pay their bill and we placed an order....no specials were read or effort made, but we placed an order. A this point I'd say 30 minutes had passed. In an attempt to redeem the situation, the waitress did offer us a drink, which was an appreciated step. The food finally arrives. I had gnocchi and lamb sauce. It was bland and lacked character. I was beyond disappointed. I was not offered pepper for my food though i saw the bottles lined up by the kitchen. The funny thing is while we were sitting there, the hostess approached a couple to let them know that their table was needed (I guess they were seemingly lingering)....the couple's response was priceless....we'd like to give up the table, but the waitress never gave us the check. The outdoor area looks nice, but I don't have plans to return anytime soon. There are just too many alternatives to pay to be ignored and to eat bland food."

Having seen their menu (and prices), I was skeptical. We are frequent diners at the Mon Ami Gabi chain in our area, which has similar ambiance and food, at a much more affordable price. We opted for brunch items since it was our 1st meal of the day, but I also ordered the French onion soup ($13) to gauge the place. My friend ordered the eggs benedict ($23), her friend a bowl of fruit ($13), and I got the brioche french toast w/bacon ($19). The soup came out in the standard french onion crock bowl, and I'll give them props for the cheese staying gooey til the very end, but to be honest, I prefer the soup at Mon Ami (which is also bigger, a tastier broth & only $7/8). As for our brunch items, how memorable can a bowl of fruit or eggs benny be? I thought the ham they used for the benny was so thin you could barely taste it. The waitress recommended the french toast to me, and claimed how much she loved the bacon. It came without syrup so I had to ask  for some, and I did enjoy the consistency of the toast, but that bacon..... THE WORST. It had NO flavor AT ALL. What was the waitress talking about?? I didn't even know there could be a flavorless bacon. With the exception of the burnt bits of the bacon, which tasted just like burnt flavorless grease, there was no taste to it. I even had my friend try it, and she was equally confused.

Granted, it was pretty early, 4:30pm (we caught a 2 pm showing of the Christmas Spectacular), but I would highly recommend you do the same. As we finished dinner, there was a line of people waiting for tables. / About the food: We had a party of four. They serve delicious olives and warm, just-baked bread. Very delicious. Three of us had salads - two mista, one caesar - all very well seasoned/dressed. There were a couple of very tempting specials. Two chose to go with the lasagna special, which was very delicious. Another went with ravioli + Bolognese sauce. I went with the chicken parm. Everyone was very very happy. So much so, we kept going and stuck around for coffee and dessert - delicious cheesecake. The service was awesome, too. The crew was right on it. They didn't hang around or constantly come to the table, but they were very alert - easy to flag down. And, even as the restaurant was beginning to fill up, there was never any pressure to get out and give up the table (we're smart enough diners to understand). So, in total, with salads, dinner, about 8 glasses of wine, coffee and shared desserts and tip it came to about $60 per person, which, for NY, is VERY reasonable. Assuming this restaurant performs consistently, you cannot go wrong by choosing to dine here. Buon appetito!"

The spacious dining hall with ornately decorated columns and large glass mirrors create a deliciously warm atmosphere that feels both traditional and chic at the same time. Whether you are seated at a table or a booth, be prepared for an intimate experience where you will barely be separated from adjacent guests - you will literally be rubbing elbows! Also, the vibrant energy created by the hustle and bustle of the waiters and guests and the sound of people sharing conversations can be overwhelming, but for me it was a wonderfully cosmopolitan experience. And the food! Ooh la la~ The last meal I had there was a lazy Saturday afternoon brunch with my wife so I had the Eggs Norwegian and she had the scrambled eggs in puff pastry... or was it the other way around? No matter, because we were both indulging in one another's dishes the way fat kids eat cake. The Eggs Norwegian featured perfectly cooked poached eggs with smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce and the scrambled eggs in puff pastry came with wild mushrooms and asparagus. At the end of our meal, we could feel our faces glowing the way faces allegedly glow after sex... or was it simply the French butter oozing out of us? Regardless, the meal was that orgasmic. Aside from their brunch, their bakery with French pastries is amazing, and their dinner entrees, especially my favorite, moules (mussels) and frites are heavenly. Just remember, make reservations."

Something didn't work about it for me, though my friends liked it more than I did. The best dishes were those that involved cheese (the gourgers, the ricotta appetizer).

Special mention should go to the woman on hostess duties ~ 1 week ago. There was no shortage of people queuing for a table and she was very attentive and considerate of all parties-providing updates and courteous check-ins with everyone waiting so as to ensure them they were being considered. Her service in particular set my mind at ease in knowing I came to the right spot and that everything else was likely to follow in the same vein. Sure enough it did. I left extremely satiated and didn't break the bank. Why go to Manhattan and drop $150 on a dinner for 2 when budget fine dining like this is available in BKLN?

I finally had the chance when a sushi restaurant I was going to go to was closed and this was close by so I was very happy at this serendipitous turn of events. It definitely paid off. From what I can tell, the menu changes frequently which makes each experience very fresh and unique. This can also be bad if the things you love aren't on the menu the next time you go. When I went, I fell in love with some of the small bites like tacos and oyster sliders. I could have eaten 5 oyster sliders and been happy that that was my dinner. But we ventured to try the charcuterie platter, which wasn't as good as others I've had like at the Breslin. We also got the scallops and steak option, which were ok as well.

I came here for the duck confit because I love duck confit. Sadly, they did not have it since their menu is based on what ever is fresh on the market that week (which can be good or bad depending on whether or not you like the element of surprise :p). Instead, I ordered the fried pork chop which was mmm mmm good and very filling for an entree and escargot that was a tad bit salty for an appetizer.

A Jay-Z and Beyonce special, Lucali helps makes itself a sought after place of eatery. Open from only 6 pm . on, Lucali creates its own swag by becoming somewhat exclusive as its small venue and limited hours make for an extended wait even if arriving when the doors open. Although the wait is almost guaranteed to be at least an hour, they do take your number, which allows for you to do other things while you wait. Lucali also has a ""bring-your-own-drink""  policy which can be a good use of your waiting time as you go and purchase the accompanied dinner beverage. The venue itself, aside from being small, is everything you could want from a New York eatery-grungy, rustic, while also being very modern and upscale. Regarding, specifically Italian cuisine, Lucali gets it right. The place just feels like a carbon copy of what you would imagine getting a piece of pie from an early 1900's Italian establishment would look like. Even the waiters appear Italian. Food wise, I was disappointed. Not because of the food necessary, but because the rave reviews were almost too much to hold up to. All organic ingredients, and literally made ""right before your eyes,"" the pizza cannot be more fresh. However, with that, it is hot, thin, and ultimately a somewhat runny pizza. The crust has a slight crunch, which is nice, but it is also kind of bland by itself. However, if you ask for a side of sauce, your waiter will bring you a nice spread of additional cilantro, mozzarella, and tomato sauce that helps assuage concerns about the pizza being too ""bland."" The side is also graciously free. In saying that, the pizza themselves are more on the pricey side with their basic running $24 and an additional $2-3 per topping after that. I did not get the calzone, but hear great things In conclusion, if you are looking for a high-end pizza establishment with a lot of notoriety, Lucali is your spot. If you like quality, organic ingredients, Lucali is where you want to be. If you don't mind paying around $25 per pizza, Lucali is your place. However, if you want a thicker, cheaper, pizza without the wait, as heralded as Lucali is, you might want to ""go on to the next."""

I had ordered a side of chutney but it didn't come with our order, and after looking at the check we weren't charged for it. It didn't seem worth the bother to get back in line so we let it go.

So theoretically, all the packaging is reusable and biodegradable, which is awesome. As we seperated our greasy paper from the wood, I looked around for the recycling for my can. I waited for a minute like a chump at the front until I saw the manager walking in from outside. I asked him ""where is your recycling?"" He then took the can from my hand, and spoke with wretched cigarette breath ""Commercial establishments are not required to recycle"" and threw it in the trash. I was kind of dumbfounded that he had just grabbed it from my hand and threw it away when my question clearly implied that I was looking to recycle the can. I asked him that since he wasn't required to do it that meant he didn't intend to, and he repeated the same line to me. I told him that I would have recycled that if he hadn't taken it from my hand. He then offered to get me another one. I told him I just wanted to recycle it. He reached into the trash, got it out, and then reached for a plastic bag to put it in, which totally made sense since I was looking to reduce waste, right? I told him that putting it in a bag would just make it worse, took my can back and left. On the way back to the office, I dipped into a Pret A Manger and dropped the can in their recycling. It would have been one thing if he just said they didn't have recycling, but his answer was as offensive as his cigarette breath. I won't be going back, and neither should you.

My friends and I were in NYC for one of our bi-annual business trips, and it was dead in the chill of January.  Having lived in New York as a teenager, I've always wanted to go to Balthazar.  It was in the middle of Soho, and the epitome of glamour.  I'd walk by on the cobblestone street and look into the beautiful ambers and reds, watching the beautiful people drink their bottles of wine regaling to each other their fabulous stories.  I thought to myself, I'll never be Kate Moss, therefore I will never be able to get a table at Balthazar.   Well, these days, many years later, all the beautiful people have migrated to Balthazar's trendier sister Pastis, which is great news for me and my friends. Maybe it was all those years ago, but I was still really intimidated with my preconceived notions of how this place would be.  First good sign?  8:30 pm reservations on a Friday night?  Score.   So in we walked, the three of us, seeking a warm haven from the chilly wind, and warm we definitely found.  That has to be my only semi-gripe with the restaurant, was the thermostat.  Maybe the high temp was for all the ladies who prefer to wear their sparkly dresses underneath their cashmere coats, but I was wearing a turtleneck, so it was a bit of torture.  The warmth of the host stand that greeted us matched the balmy restaurant, so that was the next pleasant surprise.  Immediately, two hostesses took our coats as the third seated us immediately amidst the bustling dining room.  That was the next great surprise.  The restaurant was packed.  I know everyone is saying that it is now a tourist trap, but who cares?!  As long as everyone is lubricated, fed, and having a hell of a time, does it really matter?  And from the looks of it, there were more native New Yorkers than tourists that evening.   The waiter was perfectly kind and helpful.  When I told him it was my brother's birthday, there was nary an eyeroll.   To start, we had the warm goat cheese tart and the spinach and ricotta ravioli.  The tart was perfectly nutty and savory, whilst the ravioli was melt in your mouth perfect.  Collective eyes back to the head at the table. We all decided to share three entrees:  The barsteak, the moule frites, and the special for the evening, which I sadly can't recall (well, it was 7 months ago.)  I think my boyfriend said it best when he took a bite from his steak and said he couldn't believe he was eating such an amazing meal for a such incredible prices in NYC.   Two bottles of wine later, the evening concluded with a complimentary caramelized banana tart.  It was one of the best meals I've had so far in my life.  It was kind of what I imagined a meal at Balthazar to feel like."

I don't usually like beans or fried food (essentially these are the two adjectives to describe falafel), but that one bite was enough to lure me into the store. I ordered the Falafel in a plain pita with Israeli Cous Cous. The falafel tasted like it just came fresh out of the fryer. Perfectly crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside. The free hummus that is included with every meal was so creamy and flavorful. The Israeli cous cous added nice texture to the dish.

My mimosa came to my table half full, but I observed someone on another table get one that was overflowing it's glass.  Another couple was quite vocal in their displeasure at being made to wait and also getting their order wrong.  One of the food handlers did not have on a hair net and she exited the establishment with the gloves she was using in the kitchen.... and returned with them on.    (Where in God's name did she go with those disposable gloves on and why couldn't she just... remove them?)   After waiting an hour - and don't get me wrong, when the waitress / cook (I have to assume this was Donna)  did come by, she offered many apologies about being short staffed and the wait (but didn't offer us anything FOR the wait - an extra drink, a piece of bread... nothing) - the shrimp and grits I ordered finally came.  It was warmish... and they cooked the shrimp in full shell.  This is a personal pet peeve of mine 1) i don't like to be reminded that shrimp are the roaches of the sea and nothing brings that home more than seeing their legs still on after cooking and 2) I wasn't into doing what I call ""arts and crafts"" with my  food where I have to get my fingers all involved.  I just wanted to eat at that point, but spent another 10 minutes shelling / scaling the shrimp. This place has SO much potential.  It's really cute, it's not designed in a way that makes it seems crowded with no one in it.  The people are extremely nice and the food is decent.  Now if the food was out of this world?

The crust is on the thin side and when I am very hungry I can eat an entire pie myself.  The pies are at their best later in the night when the oven is at its hottest.  They tend be a little chewier (rather than crisp) which I find preferable.   The calzones are terrific but best shared as they are very filling.   Lucali's really is a neighbourhood joint that became the hot place to eat pizza because of word of web and reviews.   This is why the waits can be long but what's a bit of waiting when you are among friends.

I'm more of a spicy kind of guy so I love the chicken meatballs with the spicy tomato sauce over risotto. A lot of red meats can taste quite similar to me to chicken is a good choice. The mushroom gravy is also on my top list as well. The meatballs are juicy and flavorful without the sauce but with the sauce, chew slowly to taste everything. This is one meal you don't want to rush. For dessert try the ice cream sandwich! Again check the seasonal special flavors. Around Christmas time they had a candy cane ice cream that went perfectly with their chocolate chip cookie. The cookies are chewy but firm enough to go well with the ice cream. If you don't make it there in time for the candy cane ice cream, mint is my next favorite on the list. Service is very friendly and knows that making the right choice will take some time.

Our meal started with moist slices of white and wheat bread.  My Balthazar Salad appetizer was topped with only the freshest haricots verts, asparagus, fennel, ricotta salata, and a truffle vinaigrette.  The fennel added a spike to the flavor and the crisp vegetables added a great contrasting texture.  My entree of Seared Organic Salmon was encrusted with a tangy Dijon mustard and cooked to my liking.  It was served over a creamy blend of rich lentils stewed in a chicken jus.  The flavor combination was spot on!  For dessert, I sampled (or rather inhaled) the Balthazar Bakery Tart of the Day - a flaky pie crust topped with almond paste and a caramelized mixture of pears and plums.  The sweet fruit pieces were crisp and fresh.  The pie crust was a bit less buttery than I usually prefer, but I guess I should be thankful for that since I ate the entire slice!  I also sampled my colleague's Pavlova, which is a sweet baked meringue that was topped with warm seasonal berries.  I am not usually a meringue person, but the berries added an earthy tartness to the dish.  Lastly, their coffee was nice and bold.   On another note, they offer an extension wine list and some delicious champagnes.

It was crowded, but we were able to sit at the bar right away. The bartender seemed like she [really] didn't want to be there and was not very attentive. She was friendly enough though. I got a mojito which was very tasty and strong enough. The Guac + Chips were perfect (flavor was right on target and the chips were thick and uber crispy). I got the calamari tacos. I wanted to like them. The calamari was a bit burnt (perhaps on purpose, but not to my liking) and had a very acidic flavor that made me reach for my water after every bite. I normally love calamari I'm not sure what was going on with the flavor. Not sure what the hype is all about? Not terrible by any means, but I don't think I'll be returning."

Stumbling down the street from the nearby Lorimer stop off the L train, Brooklyn Star is located on the  surprisingly quiet corner of Lorimer and Conselyea; only a block away from the always bustling Union and Metropolitan. Not knowing what to expect, we walked up the concrete handicap friendly ramp and pulled open the door of the non-descript brick building. Once inside a sizable bar greets you with ample seating both at the bar itself and at several tables lining the wall. Connected in the back of the restaurant was a full dining area with long wood tables. We received a friendly welcome from one of the wait staff and she left it up to us whether we wanted to grab a seat in the bar area or the dining area. The place had a few patrons, but due to the size of the place and that it was a dreary wednesday there were a lot of open seats. We chose the bar area. Taking a moment to get ourselves situated, I noticed that the bar has a very ""clean"" look, meaning not a lot of crap all over the place so no taxidermied animals, oddities, and typical brooklyn bar crap which is nice. huge cabinets of liquors and a couple of chalk boards above them do the work of filling the space. Seeing the numerous reviews on the country fried steak, and being that its country fried steak - how can you not appreciate deep fried steak covered in gravy with mashed potatoes? - had to try it. Also, just cause I've never had, I needed to give those deep fried pig tails a go ($12). The country fried steak was portioned well. Two steaks on top of a bed of mashed potatoes and hot slaw covered in gravy. There is supposed to be bacon somewhere there too but not sure where that went. Or I might have just devoured it in one bite. The steak itself is well done. Tasty. And the potatoes are good also. Writing about the plate is making me salivate. The deep fried pig tails were good. They were a bit price-y and I'm not sure whether I would order them again. Not that they were bad. It's just that I would liken them to buffalo wings; the tails are cut into buffalo-wing sizes and put into a buffalo-wing like sauce. They're even given to you in a bowl with a bowl for the bones. You get something like 6 pieces and 4 pieces of tots. The tots looked like hush puppies but were good and tasted from scratch. Service was on point. The kitchen turned out the food blindingly fast...that or my sense of time several drinks in was considerably warped...or both. The staff were all very pleasant and made me feel welcome. I ended up with around a 90 bill but thats taking into consideration tip as well as four shots of knob creek, two beers, the country fried steak, and deep fried pig tails. I don't think thats too bad as it would have been half that without the drinks. as the knob creek was $8 a pop. I really enjoyed Brooklyn Star, with its delicious southern inflected comfort food, solid wait staff; and comfortable atmosphere. (Plus upon leaving, I saw that they do $1 oysters during happy hour, definitely come back for that). Brooklyn Star is 5-stars!"

For instance, they have a sriracha shot and a kimchi back (like a pickleback but with kimchi juice instead). The sriracha one was...interesting.

I don't understand why so many New Yorkers are willing to endure so much punishment to eat at popular places. There are so many good places where you can sit down whenever, why would anyone regularly wait more than an hour for food? Assuming, however, that you can come at a truly off hour -- right after it opens, early in the week -- you'll find the pizza here really is quite good. I'm not sure it's good enough to justify the price, though. A pizza with one topping should cost $15, tops. At Lucali, it will set you back $30 and the pie is light enough that an adult man can easily finish a whole one. I'm willing to pay a bit more for top quality, but it's crazy to pay double, particularly give that there are a lot of places in this city that use top quality ingredients on their pizzas.

Just try it. Pistachio - Simply amazing. If you like pistachio, you'll love this. It's the perfect consistency and blend of sweetness. just right. Caramel - a bit on the sweet side but if you love caramel this is good. Coconut - Similar in flavor to the ""coconetes"" from Dominican Republic, except not as sweet. Black Violet - A bit on the sweet side as well but still good. It has a jam filling. This is particularly good, but i didn't enjoy the jam filling as much. I enjoy creamy/airy fillings instead. It was worth the wait and the price. Would I wait that long again, absolutely not. Something that was particularly annoying - the asians. They were everywhere, and lacked consideration.

Service is always friendly and knowledgeable, ambience is always warm and cozy - although it can be a bit cramped sometimes waiting for brunch - and the food is fresh, inventive, and more skillfully prepared than many more-raved about Manhattan places.  Menu changes seasonally so expect to see what is in the local farmer's market on your table - along with quite a few surprises.  There is a wait as some people have said but I always make a rez for dinner - because their cozy ambience is due to a very small dining room, which somehow never feels crowded once you sit.  Awesome experience every single time."

Rose Water manages to avoid all this, despite being quite popular.  The  interior ambiance immediately conveys a relaxed feeling that is very Brooklyn.  The staff contributes to the feeling by providing excellent service without being intrusive.  The core of the Rose Water's success is the thoughtful and creative menu.  Rose Water is committed to working with local, regional, organic and sustainably raised foods.  Even more important, the kitchen seems committed to offering delicious food.  On a recent visit with some friends, the duck confit sandwich, smoked cod cake and baked polenta with goat cheese were all delicious and wonderfully executed.  The pumpkin bread was disappointing, but pumpkin season is coming to a close. A visit to Rose Water is definitely worth the trip, especially with a $14  prix fixe brunch!"

We came by on a random weekday night at 8pm, and there were still two tables open - so no huge long line or wait, which was extra special and nice... considering I have waited long amounts for pizza at Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, Di Fara's, etc... So we opted for two pies. Nice thing is that you can do toppings by halves, so we did 1/2 basil, 1/2 basil + mushroom, 1/2 artichoke, 1/2 pepperoni. Everything was pretty amazing, especially being able to taste the fresh ingredients (who doesn't love fresh basil on their pizza?). I almost never eat artichoke pizza and it was DELISH. To add, while I was waiting in line for the bathroom, it was right in front of the wood oven with the staffer making the pizza, and he personally asked me where I came from, and if I enjoyed the pizza. I came all the way from Manhattan and he seemed really surprised! Anyhow, he was so polite and it made the experience all the more enjoyable. And how can you not love BYOB?

Many pizza places went from being pizza joints and pizzerias to being pizza restaurants. During the transformation they turned down their lights, added flickering candles, added romantic music, restricted their pizza size to one size and bumped their prices up to ridiculous levels. Make no mistake Lucali is a pizza restaurant. Don't get me wrong, Lucali actually makes a good pizza. It's just not a great pizza. And no way in hell is it worth $24. The pizza is sized kinda small so you'll likely need to order two pizzas if you want to feed two hungry people. That means by the end of the night, you're talking about dropping 60 bucks for pizza for two. Yes, 60 bucks for pizza for two. And that's in Brooklyn of all places. The center of the pizza is very thin, the sauce is sweet, and they use a nice mixture of mozzarella and parmegian cheeses, although they congeal way too fast. I like the overall floppiness of the slices (they're sort of New Haven-esque). Unfortunately the Lucali crew skip putting ingredients on roughly 33% of the pizza, around the pizza's perimeter to be exact. So right after you've finished eating the interior of the pie, you're left to eating lots of expensive crusty pieces.

It's $12 for just the crab roll and $15 for the combo which comes with chips and a drink (bottled or their homemade drinks). The crab had no mayo just butter, similar to a Connecticut style lobster roll. It's a cute little ""shack"" in Crown Heights. Doesn't blend in with the rest of buildings on block, decor is what you expect to see at a beach food spot. However this is what makes it unique. Brooklyn is the new it spot and restaurants like The Crabby Shack make it so. Awesome decor (check), good food (check) incredible customer service (check) and the option to eat in or take out (check). Now with such a rave review why only 4stars? When I called in my order I asked if the buns was toasted and I was assured they were. However upon eating my roll the bun was not toasted. Crab was also served on a potato hot dog roll. I expected more but the bread didn't take away from sandwich outside of it not being toasted. I'm happy I got two rolls because one surely wasn't going to satisfy this self proclaimed foodie."

However, I feel every time I go the food keeps getting more and more ""meh"". Recently, the always satisfying Bibb Lettuce salad was lacking on the toppings and the kick. The daily special pizza we had was basically sparse meat crumbles on a sparingly sauced pie. Also, the last few waitresses we've had have been almost annoyed to even be working. I get the cool, Brooklyn shtick but in a world where 20% is just expected, try a little harder. A smile never killed anyone. All this aside, its still a great hang out spot in summer. Maybe by the time the garden thaws, they'll be back on the ball."

The beef tongue was also quite good though it didn't blow me away like the carnitas did. The fish was only okay - it did not taste fresh and had that give-away stinky fish taste. Not a fan of that. The menu here is not very vegetarian friendly so the boyfriend, who is vegetarian, ended up getting two cactus tacos (the only vegetarian option in the taco category) and a plain cheese quesadilla. He did not like the cactus at all. He made a weird face upon his first bite and told me that the texture was really fibrous and unpalatable. He only ate one of the two cactus tacos. The plain cheese quesadilla was apparently very mediocre. Sorry vegetarians, looks like this is just not the place for you.

However, it was five sparkly stars on a Monday night - perfect for the anti-Valentine's Valentine date I was sort of on. Nice and private, but minimal PDA from the couple couples that were in attendance. The music, presumably controlled by a living, breathing DJ tucked out of site in some mini cavern somewhere, was non-incidental; The Cure, MGMT, stuff like that. Sorry I never found out if it was cash only or not because for the first time practically ever, I was prepared with the lettuce in hand. We had our first pints of ale at 9:30 p.m. or so. The next round, I made the leap from Blue Moon to a Guinness...the one woman manning the bar was definitely in her happy place; consequently, I went all the way to the bathroom and back and the drinks still weren't ready. It doesn't take THAT long to fill a pint glass with frothy stout! In a generally good mood, I waited patiently while she talked to a young, edgy looking married couple she seemed to know well and multitasked a bit with White Russians for a party known as ""the film people"" seated at a table. She told me one of my beers would arbitrarily be charged at the happy hour price. When she finally brought me the drinks, she said, ""They're both happy hour, because I knew that took FOREVER."" Sweet! Soon, we were convinced that neat whiskey and dirty martinis were definitely the way to go, tomorrow be damned. She poured generous tumblers of whiskey and made proper martinis (meaning she chilled the glass by setting it aside with ice in it, meaning she knew that the default base when someone says ""martini"" is gin, and not VODKA, as some greehorns actually believe). The unexpected bonus was a huge cup of olives that she plunked down at our table, saying, ""Olives. I forgot these. Here they are."" It was as big as the cup that most bars keep behind the counter so they can garnish a hundred separate martini orders. The next time I went and got yet another dirty martini, I thanked her for the most lavish helping of olives I had ever received in my life. ""Oh! Yeaaah, seriously, what happens in bars is that we have to use all the juice out of the jar for dirties, then the olives get dry and we end up just throwing tons of them away. So obvious, but I had never figured that out. ""That's HORRIBLE!"" I shrieked, eyes even watering a bit. Yeah, I was buzzed. ""Do you just want like a whole PINT glass of olives?"" She asked nonchalantly. Hell yes...so we picked off about three pounds of salty, pitless olives. The result? The clock moved like it was on time lapse photography and we shut the place down at 4 a.m.... No hangover the next morning - just puckered lips and an intense feeling of unquenchable thirst, not to mention a level exhaustion tormenting even the hairs on my head. This was an original experience, probably thanks mainly to the bartender (who also brought us tall ice waters without us asking right when we needed it), along with the nude paintings on the bathroom doors (though a couple dudes still utilized the facilities behind the door with the naked, breasty female on it)... To preserve this enjoyable atmosphere as the brine filled jar preserves a turgid olive, I will never bother to come here on a weekend night. Weekdays, however, will be other stories."

My girlfriend had read good things and although it was a bit more ""fine dining"" than we'd planned on, it was already 11:45pm and the options for quality fare were few. As soon as we walked in, we knew we'd made the right decision. The ambiance was warm and inviting with just a touch of classy Christmas decor. Even at that hour, there was still a good crowd, adding an air of energy to the room. We were immediately seated and opted to indulge in a couple of their signature cocktails. It was one of the few times I felt the drink was worth the $14, and that says a lot. We started off with the lobster and black truffle risotto, which was savory and creamy. I had the duck confit and my girlfriend tried the steak frite. The duck was amazing! So tender it fell right off the bone. Unfortunately the steak frite left something to be desired. It was a bit tough and not very flavorful. For this I had to knock them a star. For dessert we split the creme brulee- sheer perfection! What stood out even more than the cuisine was the service. This is one of those places that you know prides themselves on running like a well oiled machine. We had two servers working in tandem, both of which were attentive without hovering. Everything we ordered came out almost immediately but tasted fresh and made to order. As late diners, we also appreciated their weekend hours (open till 2am Fri/Sat)- we weren't seated until almost midnight yet never felt rushed. Our tab was just under $200 and yet I don't think we could have left happier. THAT is the mark of a truly great restaurant."

This is a spicy dish which is perfect to thaw you out on a cold winter day. It has a good balance of chicken, peppers & string beans and a pool of spicy soup at the bottom that you can coat your rice with. Prices are affordable but not the cheapest. Food servings depend on which dish you are ordering so I suggest yelping out pictures before ordering them. Food service was always good and their servers are very friendly. I like the ambiance of the restaurant. It's Zen meets chic. The decor is ingenious too because they use ordinary objects and turn them into quite a presentation (like chopped wood as accent wall). The only gripe I have is that the space can be very constricting specially if you're in a large party. But this is not enough to deter me from giving the place 5 stars.

Since its opening in 1997, it's commanded a key part of NYC's dining scene; unsurprisingly, lengthy wait times and constantly filled seats are the norm here. The venue can seat just shy of 200 people, and on an average day, serves around 1,500 guests; small wonder that there never seems to be any downtime during service. The best chances at getting seated are during the opening or closing hours, and a mid-morning arrival meant that more than a handful of tables were still unoccupied. On my prior visit, I had been able to try the Oeufs Meurette, an excellent dish that melded the acidity of red wine with poached eggs, mushrooms, and a few slivers of crisp bacon. On my return visit, I opted to try a different range of dishes offered. First: the Chicken Liver and Foie Gras Mousse. In retrospect, calling this dish a ""mousse"" is somewhat misleading, as it's not as airy or light as one would imagine. Nonetheless, the blending of chicken liver and foie gras is seamlessly done, and the end result is velvety, creamy, and rich; a decadent first bite, to be sure. The plate came with grilled country bread and a pat of red onion confit, and the latter was a much needed addition. In contrast to the liver, the confit contributed some much needed sweetness and acidity and the country bread served as a crisp, lightly charred vessel to balance out each bite. The Eggs in Puff Pastry is one of Balthazar's most popular brunch dishes, an impressive plate at first glance: scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms and asparagus stalks are served with two pieces of puff pastry. The eggs were well-executed; moist, well-seasoned, and complemented well in both flavor and texture by the addition of the mushrooms and asparagus. The puff pastry had to be the disappointing component, as it was far too dry and stiff, not at all flaky or buttery as it should have been. This was thankfully saved by the Crème Brûlée, a generously portioned dessert that was delicious from the first bite to the last. The brûléed crust was crisp, a delight to crack into with the spoon. The custard base is the example of textural perfection; silky, yet firm, able to hold its structure yet still yield without resistance to the spoon's edge. The generous amount of vanilla bean with just a touch of cinnamon were pleasantly noted, a revelation when complemented with just the right amount of sweetness. For some, there's plenty of reasons to avoid Balthazar. The brasserie can no longer be considered new or modern, the constant turnover of tables doesn't encourage slowly-paced meals or quiet conversations, and the prices are high, even by NYC standards. Yet, the allure that Keith McNally has crafted at Balthazar is unavoidable, and promises an experience as unique as the city it resides in."

Gave Traif a second try, and it was much better this time, definately came on their off day before... I wasn't as impressed as I hoped to be the first time. I felt like everything was just alright. The second time here was a friend's bday with 8 people and we were set up with a pre-fix for $55pp. You get 8 tapas, 2 per each side of the table, where we all get one whole piece to ourselves. Really filling and much more worth it... Plus they give you most of their top regular signature tapas! I still feel like it's a bit overhyped and over priced for a simple tapas joint with small portion. There's definitely way more better tapas joint in NY. Some of my more favored tapas I would order again from here: STRAWBERRY CINNAMON GLAZED RIBS - Awful & let down the first time. I remember this was the dish I was most excited for because everyone orders this, and c'mon it looked&sounded delicious. First time I had it, it was so hard and crunchy on the top. The ribs were not a bit tender at all that we had to yank it off the bone hard with our teeth. Second time, was a charm. It tasted much better and was more tender where you could just fork it off the bone... Now that's what in talking about, how ribs are suppose to be. DAYBOAT SCALLOPS - definitely the best dish out of all from the first&second time here. The scallops are good but they're whatever I've had better... But risotto is consistent! Makes the highlight of the dish, however I liked the first time risotto even better when it was a savory corn risotto! SPICY TUNA TARTARE OVER TEMPURA EGGPLANTS - mMm this probably comes second best. BRAISED SHORT RIB SLIDERS W/ SWEET POTATOES FRIES &SMOKED PAPRIKA AIOLI - My third favorite, short ribs are yummy and tender. Sweet potatoe fries are perfect accompaniment and that sauce is the best part, interesting and addicting... Soo good like CRACK. Least favorite tapas: Jumbo prawns cooked in foie gras fat- these shrimp weren't tiger shrimp. You could tell they weren't even fresh, but frozen. Can't tell at all it was cooked in foie gras either. Waste of $20. Rip off. Seared foie gras w/ sausage&sunny side eggs - SO MUCH OIL. I LOVE foie gras but this didn't cut it for me. The foie gras wasn't good, lower grade like foie gras. The combination on the plate didn't work with the foie gras for me either. Veal sweetbreads - the sweetbreads left a bad after taste stuck onto my tounge. **BTW BACON DOUGHNUTS A MUST GET & PANNA COTTA FOR DESSERT. HEAVEN. YUM"

My boyfriend and I came by yesterday to do what we typically do- a long walk around Brooklyn, and lunch in a cozy restaurant, especially since it was out 3 year anniversary. We are so happy we stumbled in, first off the prices are beyond fair, and the service is exceptional.Since they have quite a collection of taps, and I say this in regards to the uniqueness of the taps, the bartender let us have a few samples before we were able to decide. Let me emphasize this again- their taps are killer! Also, their cocktails are genuine, a nice mix of simplicity and innovation without trying to hard. We ordered a beet salad, which was scrumptiously good! Simple- fresh- and left us wanting more. My bf ordered the mussels- this is atypical of him, since he seldom trusts the quality of seafood in many establishments, his verdict: these are the freshest mussels I've ever had. Also the bartender/server was kind enough to cater the broth to his tastes! I had the eggplant sandwich. Is it just a sandwich, typically I would say Yes, however the eggplant tapanade was so flavourful and delectable that I could have scarfed down ten more. It came with a side of greens, which I highly appreciate! I commend this place on decreasing the carb options. Having my salad without bread, and my sandwich with salad instead of fries really open the palate to the cocktails and is friendlier on the waist-line! Also before you complain helps keep costs down! For such an enjoyable meal consisting of  2 entrees an appetizer and a cocktail, wine and a Guinness (on tap!) we played about 50.00 after tax! That  is hard to beat! We can't wait to come back! ------------ A note in regards to comments about inflation. I thoroughly disagree. This place deserves all its merits. I typically would agree with those types of  comment on comparison, however as someone who has dined at per se and jean george's, per se (and other fine dining establishments),- I would take this food over theirs, my exception is Jose Garces' food in Philly, hands down the best! Ironically I came to Hamilton's yesterday and later forayed to jean george's joint, spice market. A place I highly advocated in the past, however being meticulous and having an assembly line are two different things. I would certainly go here over any of those places,at this point. The food here is crafted better and the flavours are there- thus my first comment- this place has soul! . I am a bit more limited in my selection here as a vegetarian,  and yes there is less refinement, but the food just tastes better. Call me crazy- but that's the truth!"

What I do have a problem with...waiting 15 minutes before a waiter came....music so loud that you can't hear your friends speak....a messed up order....a bad attitude. One of these is forgivable...all 4, not so much. Yes, we waited 15 minutes before a waiter came to us. We asked one waiter politely to turn the incredibly loud rock music down. He said he would and didn't. The table next to us also complained about the loud music and we all asked another waiter to turn it down. His response..""We need it loud to keep the energy up."". WTF?! I'm sorry...I thought I was at a nice restaurant for brunch, not a rock concert or club. I yelled back...""I don't care! None of us can hear each other speak!"" I was infuriated by the lack of care that was given to the customers here. Many reviews mention the overly loud music. No one wants to scream over music at brunch. I don't know what these people are thinking. I'm a professional musician, for pete's sake, so I'm certainly not a music hater. But there's something called appropriate. A few minutes later, the music was turned down and we all...with perfectly good energy...enjoyed our conversations. But a few minutes later, it was turned up again. I decided to let it go. Our food finally came and they brought me the wrong dish. I had ordered the Hangtown Fry and they brought out a short rib hash. Perhaps if the music hadn't been so loud, the server might have heard my order. He did apologize and brought me out a biscuit to munch on. Finally, my food came. It's a delicious dish, overall, but one of the oysters spilled out its innards in a disgusting fashion and it was difficult to eat after that. The other oysters had been fine. My friend ordered the braised greens , but didn't like them (I tasted them and didn't care for them, either, and I usually love braised greens). The meat in them tasted off and there was too much vinegar. They did take those off of the bill, which was nice of them. But given the issues we had, I highly doubt I'll be coming here again.

I love the crepes here, especially the sweet ones. I've been here twice and tried the Matcha Stripe Chocolate and the Fuji Apple Pie. GET THE FUJI APPLE PIE! Even if you don't like raisins or walnuts, keep 'em in the crepe (unless you're allergic.. of course) and feel that delicious chewiness and surprise crunchiness as you eat the crepe. I appreciate when there are different textures in food, so I loved the Fuji Apple Pie. The crepe itself isn't too heavy and has a lightness that doesn't settle like rocks in your stomach. I went here with a friend who has tried a savory crepe and a sweet crepe, and she loved both. You can order a custom crepe, but I don't know how much the standard pricing is for the crepe, only the pricing for the topping. She got a crepe with strawberries, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream, and it came out to $6.50. I think the most inexpensive crepe here is Double the Eggs, Double the Fun, which is $6. I hope they come up with a custom ordering menu... cause that would be fun to play around with (and also.. NUTELLA please? :)) One thing--don't bother with the Yuzulade. That was just iced water with some candied Yuzu peel and pulp. Not that refreshing. At $3.25 a cup, I expect it to at least quench my thirst... nope. This place is small with room for 2 seats and a small bench outside the store.. so if you want to eat here, I would go at a quiet hour or go eat it in a park.

The downside is that it was not hot enough for me. My boyfriend ordered Kamo Seiro which is a sauteed duck slice & tokyo negi in hot dipping sauce. The duck was delicious!! the soup itself was soothing for winter. I would recommended getting the duck instead of the chicken. The waiter then gave us a pot of soup to mix with the sauce and drink the soup. It was delicious, but i preder my boyfriend's broth.

Seriously???  In the owner's own words ""they scream and yell"" and make it uncomfortable for other parties.  Now if you are the single couple you may see this as a plus, but if, like ourselves you are relatively new parents who enjoy your child's presence on a  family night out you may be appalled by these comments.  Needless to say we will never be going back to this place.  It not only completely rude of the owner to make assumptions about how my child behaves but I thought the Italian culture was all about family.  This is the only place I've ever been discriminated against for having a child.  I've taken my child to many a restaurant, nicer & fancier than this place, not one place has ever said something to me about having my child with me.  Plenty of restaurants I can go to, will never have to worry about this."

More of a French/Spanish style than the well known Peruvian trademark. Seasoned with thinly sliced Celery & Red Bell Peppers and Fresh Lemon Juiive and just enough capers that popped in your mouth. Grilled Sardine: Very Fresh & well prepared. Dices of  Sauted fennel & tyhme ontop grilled bread and butterflied sardines grilled to perfection and topped with a thinly sliced onion and arugala salad and garnished with supremes of blood orange. A little more acid component to the dish would have really helped. Steak Frites: I asked the waiter what cut is the steak and he said it was a Rump Steak, never heard of that cut before. Very tasty ans flavorfull. served with crispy pommes frite and a maitre d' hotel butter. Best steak frites I had so far. Bouillabase: Came in a cast iron pot and the lid was removed in front of you. My wife got hit with a steam facial of Seafood, really nice touch. For the price I think the value element was there, it lack seafood but the flavor was right on! The rouille was of the hook, we asked for more. Spinach & Riccotta Raviolis: served with a Buerre Noissette ( Brown Butter) my daughter liked the plate clean, and she usaully doesn't finish. Profiterlos: My daughter scarfed them down! I got in one only bite. A text book preparation, fluffy & tender. Served with vanilla ice cream and warm chocolate . Tarte Tatin.

Lots of parts of BK, but not Red Hook. (Not even to the Ikea or Fairway.) I had to trust the GPS on this one. When Van Brunt dead ended, I was a little worried, because I did not see a sign. But I got out and parked the car and walked to where 454 had to be. And there is was. I walked around the corner and inside is exactly what I'd expect from brisket. There's blues-y honkey tonkish sort of music playing. Check. There's a bartender with a sleeve tattoo. Check. There's a great selection of bourbon. Check. There was a guy who wore flip flops with a cammy hat. Check. The only difference between this and any of the places in the South that serve brisket would be that hipsters (and professional types) have replaced all the folks wearing polo and SEC affiliated baseball hats. The vibe is very nice. You wait in line. It's a long line. And at the end of that line they serve you the food. It's weighed. I don't get that but, it is what it is. For a group, I ordered the brisket, the $25 beef rib and chicken, with mac and cheese and potatoe salad. They boxed it up right in front of me and I went to the bar to get a drink while the chicken came out. The potato salad has no mustard. So that's a no go. It was bland. The mac and cheese was OK. The chicken was decent. BUT THE BRISKET WAS OFF THE CHAIN. World class. Get that stuff now. Don't play around with the rest of the menu. The brisket over came everything.

My choice for entree was the Tagliatelle with anchovies and walnuts. It was just the right amount of oil and garlic as some places either have it swimming or bone-dry.

I noticed the wait staff was buzzing like a shore town preparing for a hurricane. Guess dinner gets pretty crazy. I ordered the Vongole, would have went with a small salad as well but $12 didnt seem worth it. Just moments later my food arrived, I had not even finished buttering my bread. Oh well I was dining alone, which can sometimes give off the impression that the person is in a rush....that was until the table next to me had the same problem. They (1 man 2 Women) ordered oysters, soup & salads then main courses. Oysters arrived first as they should but moments later ALL of the rest of their food came out. The man of the group told the runner to take it back. When their waiter returned the man explained that after they finish the oysters they would like the salads and soup then after that the main course. 20 mins later he had to send his soup back because it was cold...Suprised? So the rushed service was my first beef my second beef was with the value. I felt like my meal should have been more like $15 not $25.

The snacks are sized for a single person appetizer (My girlfriend and I split the pond wings, it was two fairly small legs) with the small plates definitely being portioned to share (The grilled squid was faaaaaaantastic!). I got the Phork Chop, and my girlfriend got the Flank. Both were delicious in their own right, but the Phork Chop with the peanut sauce was out of this world. The summer rolls were a little bland, but the rest of the dish more than made up for it. Service was fantastic - very laid back attitude, but very professional attentiveness. Five stars for the wait staff. Here's the only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars. Dessert. There's no dessert menu, and your choices are the Fois Gras Doughnut (I still can't see how this is appetizing to people) or a frozen snickers bar. We went with the snickers ice cream bar expecting something ""deconstructed"" or similarly complex. Nope. It's a snickers ice cream bar. Like the kind you get from the vending machine. They cut it into four pieces with the wrapper on and serve it with strawberries and powdered sugar (powdered over the wrapper). If it didn't only cost $3 I'd be a little more upset, but given what it was and the cost, it's a little comical. Overall would definitely come back and recommend to friends, but maybe skip dessert and head next door to Dynaco for an after-dinner drink and piece of cake =)"

Came here today for lunch with my off-the-boat halal indian friend. I figured if i'm getting Indian food in NYC, she will be the best judge. I checked the menu out beforehand but didn't fully come to a decision. I took the depressing walk up Broadway to 39th (I hate herald square. How does it always take me 45 min to walk 7 blocks?) and come to the storefront for Kati. The line was all the way to the door so I got worried - however, thanks to my fellow yelpers, I was prepared for this and gave myself extra time (my clients and their problems could wait... nothing comes in between me and my paratha). Got to the front of the line and had a mini panic attack... with so many options, was I really prepared for my order? Knowing how long the line was, I cracked and chose 2 chicken tikka masala rolls (one of my FAVORITE indian dishes). However, I didn't even check to see if they had paneer (my other favorite indian food), but apparently they do, though it's marinated 'in a spicy pickle' which sounds gross. OK.. best priced meal for the amount you get in this area. I know everyone says they get 2 rolls, and I followed suit... however, I was full after 1! considering I could've eaten a satisfying meal for $5 (5 for 1, $9 for 2), hands down this is a better value than much of midtown lunch. The roll was amazing! I love spicy, and even this had more of a kick than I was prepared for. Oh and the approval of my friend? Definitely. She got the same and the unda shami roll which she said was even better. Even though it was crowded, it was pretty easy to get a table, so definitely a place you can sit and eat at, as long as you don't mind feeling like you're eating on a boat (table was wobbly as shit so the boat analogy was due to a boat rocking? Get it? Ok forget it, I get it's lame). I have to go back soon and try their other rolls.... but definitely one of the best places i've eaten in this tourist-drenched area."

The Grand Opening was in late July, so im guessing late June is when I first went. They were only open sporadically then and they were testing out the drink and food menu and they were training the staff. To be fair, i must state that i am one of the unofficial ""Mayors"" of Brooklyn and especially of the restaurant/lounge/club/social scene in fort greene/clinton hill/bed stuy/crown heights. Live in brooklyn my entire life and Fort Greene from 1992 to 2006. See my first Yelp writeup of Nobar as Ive just begun to document some of my ventures after about a thousand suggestions to do so. Now to the place Soco. Beautiful looking place. Owned by family who owns Negril on LaGuardia Place in Manhattan. Bar is awesome and run by a guy named George. He runs it like a well oiled machine. He has a diverse staff- Nico and Jeanette and George are the main ones that served me and they all are awesome. The cucumber( gin) and canteloupe(tequila) drinks are to die for. They serve Tito's vodka as their house vodka and before Soco I had never heard of it. The group I was with one night ranted and raved about it so much that it( Tito's) is my main drink now mixed with various juices or seltzer. I counted 26 bottle beers that they serve and they now have 3 or 4 on tap. You can eat at the bar and the service is GREAT!!! I've been there on almost every night of the week- I would guess about 12 times since they opened a month and a half ago. On Fridays and Saturdays they have a doorman/bouncer- a Hispanic, very nice professional guy who is security. Went with a group a week ago and had a ""problem"" b/c he( doorman) told a guy in my group to remove his hat. The bouncer and owner Mark explained to me when I went back to try to convince them to allow my friend in with his Yankee cap that they couldn't     make an exception, etc. etc. etc.   My friend refuses to return. I went back a week later and Owner Mark apologized to me and said he was trying to control the crowd and suppress a few rowdy incidents that had just occurred that night. I understood but explained that a screenign process other than headgear might be a better plan. Passed by SOCO last night, Tuesday,  8/2/2011 after dinner/drinks at Luz on Vanderbilt and it was PACKED as though it were a weekend. They had a live band and the I caught the last part but the band was AWESOME!!! Soco is very attentive and responsive to contructive criticism, not complaining and trying to get over, but constructive criticism. Had the wings, 1/2 barbq chicken, collard greens, mac and cheese, fried chicken and waffle to eat thusfar. My crew had the salmon, pork chops, grits, cornbread and almost every other dish and every dish is described as good, very good or excellent. One of the owners/partners Sim seems like a great guy, and Owner/partner Melissa is GREAT!!! It is kind of a ""scene"" place. meaning that it attracts good looking, on the move people who want to be seen and at the hot spot. The doorman is needed b/c it has a lot of open space where people stand around and watch. Live DJ's some nights- last week was Misbehavin on Friday and Hard Hitting Harry on Saturday. Harry tore it up, Misbehavin was cool too but drew a lighter crowd.  Again, doorman is a necessary expense b/c my many years experience show that the deadly combo of alcohol, music and women make men( people in general) act a bit aggressive and out of character. In summary, it is aTERRIFIC place and going to do very, very well if they keep up the excellent service, quality, staff  and entertainment.   Highly recommended and best wishes to them.  More to follow......"

Everything about our experience was lovely - we came half an hour early and were seated immediately, our servers were attentive and friendly, the noise level was not too loud thus creating more intimacy (excessive noise is a pet peeve of mine at a lot of these small west village spots), and the food was very very well done. We started with the spicy duck meatballs and gnocchi. Both were very good, but I especially loved the the duck meatballs. I wish I could have had a whole plate of them for my main course, even though I really enjoyed what we ordered for that as well. Next we split the hanger steak and the chicken 3 ways. The steak was very good as well, but probably my least favorite item I tried, only because it was the least unique for me and my tastes. The chicken, which I didn't really expect to love (chicken is usually boring), was SO GOOD. The  meat was SO moist, I wish I could recreate it at home. The pate and mini waffles were amazing as well. I never thought I would wholeheartedly recommend a chicken dish, but I absolutely do. Even the bread they served was very good. We were too stuffed for dessert, but I don't doubt that it would have been great. Perfect place for a more intimate date night and it won't totally break the bank."

Also ordered was the Burrata special which came on a bed of juicy beefsteak tomatoes drizzled with balsamic.  Kinda pricy at $16 but totally worth it because it was a big mofo burrata that's flown in from Italy.  Not available everyday so jump on it if you get the chance! Slightly less successful, though still super tasty, was the Branzino special ($22).  A huge dish with mussels, calimari, and salmon in a tomato sauce.  I just really hate when there are bones and scales (because I'm a lazy eater) but I understand it comes with the territory.   The service was very attentive, though slightly confusing since we had 2 waiters that both came over to read us the specials.

Whether you are coming on a date or a small gathering of friends or family, it's perfect. It is very quaint/ small/ intimate, lighted mainly by candles and a few low-lit ceiling lamps. Atmosphere feels very rustic Italian. The bathroom has a fun, vintage, surprise too. As for food, all they offer is GREAT pizza and toppings, and calzone (haven't tried that yet as there is usually no room left after the pizza). I love a place that is focused on just the pizza, makes it that much more special. A pie for two people is absolutely doable if you come hungry, they even reheated our last slice as per our request. Fresh ingredients ALL the time + candles everywhere + BYOB = BEST pizza outing. EVER."

Just keep in mind that they somehow americanize some dishes and some of them are still quite classic, so it depends. My favorites. Are obviously the escargots and the chicken mousse as the appetizers. The chicken mousse comes as a little upside-down pinkish tower (hemisected cone if you will) and it has a salad like thing and crispy bread as a side. Escargots with the butter are delicious. Though they are very filling. Entrees. Plats du jours are very good, such as the bouillabaisse and the braised short ribs, it depends on which day you were there. Also their burgers, a cheval with an egg on top are very nice. Their fetuccine with the pesto is very nice as well as the steak with the puree and the haricots verts as the sides are perfectly delicious. As desserts you should have either the pot de creme or the profiterole. The latter comes with a sizable chocolate sauce as a side that they pull over the vanilla ice cream stuffed puff profiterolles so it is a perfect balance. Balthazar has an extensive winelist as well. They have a reserve selection, many rose and half bottle options as well as their huge carafes.

And the food was so underwhelming.  The mussels we actually sent back - something I literally never do as I dislike the embarrassment - because at least two were clearly not fresh.  The pappardelle was bland and under-seasoned. Same for that night's special greens, despite the presence of grilled nectarine and peaches!  And even the Vietnamese spare ribs, which we all thought would be a sure hit...they were fine, but no one at the table was excited about them.  Not next to so many sub-par dishes.

Balthazar is the less crowded, more typical French restaurant. This place is much bigger than Pastis which could be why it doesn't seem as packed as Pastis. The ideas are basically the same however, cook good food in a chic environment and don't make it too overpriced so we don't have to rival Le Cirque. The main difference is Balthazar's clientele seemed a bit older than Pastis' young Meatpacking District crowd, but never the less its still a great place to go with friends for a good dinner. Balthazar also cooks with peanut oil, but they are very attentive and alert in altering your meals and making sure that your food doesn't have any allergens. Just putting this out there, Balthazar's bread is not anything special, just so you don't get disappointed when the bread isn't spectacular...because it just isn't and Pastis hypes it up WAY too much for what it is. Now on to the real food. For an appetizer I had the Seafood Ceviche, which was basically a chilled seafood salad. A bit peppery, but the seafood (lobster, shrimp and squid) was very tasty and fresh. For an entree I had the Duck Confit. The portion was generous and the confit was very moist and tasty. The potato chips (fried in the duck's fat instead of peanut oil), complemented the dish very well. Desert, well, wasn't possible as everything had some form of nut in it, but I did enjoy my cafe au lait.

My girlfriend had the sangria and said that was great too (4.5), I had the Cristal Cerveza Peruana for my first time and it was really good, I will be seeking it out now. We will definitely be back."

Our table was extremely tiny and we were practically shoulder-to-shoulder with the parties to either side of us (probably not the best place to have a conversation about your latest sexcapade or whatever other TMI news you have). But it didn't matter...we just wanted to eat! The French onion soup may very well be the best I have ever eaten. Unfortunately, it was so ridiculously good that I ate the whole (huge) thing and was so stuffed I could only eat about half of my main dish, the Eggs Bella Donna. The half I did manage to fit into my stomach was simple decadence (oxymoron? maybe...) with perfectly poached eggs, thin slices of pancetta and parmesan, a hearty mix of spinach, tomato, and mushroom, and polenta that was so creamy it was practically a custard.

For this reason, I HAD TO make Balthazar part of the happiest moment of my life. One word: Croquembouche. It is the only part of marriage I've thought about since I was a kid... A tower of sweet caramelized profiteroles and a traditional French wedding ""cake"", a true king of desserts. Cue Mark Tasker: man at least half responsible for my emotional well-being and handsome pastry chef at Balthazar. He had me at ""sure I can make a Croquembouche... Here have some profiteroles"". Don't tell my husband Mark (can I call you Mark?), but I love you. My mother and I sat outside and stuffed our pretty little faces with your samples. The Croquembouche was perfect, beautiful, and included the sugar violets I brought. A Croquembouche for 80 guests will run you about $450. It was A LOT of dessert but there were seconds.

Once we returned we still had to wait 15 mins to get seated and it took another 15 or so to get the bill at the end of the meal. The buns are okay but not amazing, I assume their fame is because they started the trend for NYC - the ones at Ippudo and Baohaus are better.

Answer... when said establishment delivers. Saddened as I was by the closure of Cafe 202, after Nicole Fahri sold her soul to The French Connection, this departure has led me to great new culinary experiences. And while I have been slow to review Cookshop after several visits, it is apparent that this place is one of evolutionary loyalty. Reality has definitely trumped perception. An all-around, locavore foodie experience, my visits until recently have been limited to four-star lunch and brunch... Lunch and dinner this last week, however, have been exquisite from beginning to end. During a fantastic lunch one recent afternoon, we were seated in a booth next to Brooke Shields, (looking beautiful, sans make-up, an anomaly that I attributed to her role on Broadway as Morticia in The Addams Family).  My house-prepared pastrami sandwich left me adamant that I would never, ever visit another New York deli. So, I convinced my ""sort-of-best-friend"" in town for the week from Los Angeles that we really, really needed to skip the Green Table (her New York fave, and where I had been five times in two weeks), and that we really, really needed to go back to Cookshop for dinner. We ventured north after a visit to OWS at Zucotti Park for a civilized, establishment-style meal. And this is where Cookshop resonated with me, cooking on all five cylinders. Arriving a half-hour early for our reservation, we were directed to the bar, where Marcello prepared the perfect martini, with Crop organic vodka. It was as though I had made it myself. (My friend's lemon-drop was not quite her preference, but not for lack of Marcello's valiant efforts.) Seated at probably one of the best tables in the house, dinner just escalated from there, an experience that was replicated the next evening when I was hosting another guest in town. In two evenings, with my friends, I managed to rotate the roasted chicken, the rabbit and the scallops. Each was perfectly accented with local herbs and vegetables, and perfectly prepared to complement the main dish. These have been meals that rival the best-of-the-best in New York. And the service has been impeccable as the food. Fast forward to this last weekend... Not only was I remembered as a regular, they immediately found me a table in a manner that I'm not allowed to disclose, and delivered the most perfect huevos rancheros, something that you can't even find at the best-of-the-best Mexican restaurants in this city. Cookshop is so much more uniquely New York than the ever-present Duane Reade. If you want *real* food, and great service, this is as good as gets."

I always get worried when ordering cocktails at a new restaurant because I never know if the bartender will make the drink to my liking.  I requested to have a cosmopolitan, but only with a splash of cranberry juice (hardly a Cosmo, I'm aware).  When I received my drink it was the sweetest ""splash"" of cranberry I've ever encountered and I couldn't drink more than 3 sips.   Next was my meal, the Jambalaya dish that I was excitedly looking forward to.  My plate wasn't even hot when it came to the table - I ate a forkful and it was cold.  Additionally, there was NO flavor whatsoever.  I ended up eating the fries off of my boyfriend's plate because the jambalaya was so unappetizing.  My boyfriend also wasn't a fan of the burger he ordered, which I would imagine is a standard and easy dish to perfect.

What seems to be the ""chupacabra"" of all reservations, I had the pleasure of dining at Rao's last night. I normally put a large emphasis on the food side when dining out but its impossible to ignore the decor and service side of your meal when dining here. I will not sit here and describe each dish using words like ""moist"", ""nom nom"", ""cheesy"", ""to die for"". I just write reviews the way I would want to read them from someone who knows what good food is. Service and Decor: 5 Stars You really do feel like you are in someones home when you enter. It really is very difficult to explain the vibe inside unless you have been there. I will say I understand why people enjoy going on a regular basis. For those of you who are star struck...the sightings can be overwhelming (I took the seat of a man who's name rhymes with Footy Hallan). The owners make you feel welcomed and Nicky ""The Vest"" couldn't be nicer. Around 11:30 the Jukebox was turned on and we were fortunate enough to see Mr. Pelligrino (and an unnamed 5 time Grammy Award winner) do a medley of songs for the patrons while a Hall of Fame Super Bowl winning Cowboy got up and joined them for the ""Macarena"". Memories that were worth the trip alone. Food: 3.5 The food is Good! It's not going to be the best Italian food you have ever had but certainly far from the worst. We really didn't have a bad dish and all of the classic staples were present. Someone pulls up a chair, sits down at the front of your table and says ""Ok, this is what we have tonight"". The must gets when at Rao's: *Seafood Salad *Mozzarella en carroza *Orecchiette with broccoli rabe and Sausage *Veal Parmesan *Black Raspberry Ice Cream ***Must Get:   Meatballs The price was VERY reasonable (with wine and after dinner drinks included) I can only hope I am fortunate enough to spend another memorable evening there in the future."

The staff and atmosphere gave me confidence that the whole dining experience was going to be good, but sadly the food was a huge let down. Escargot were extremely bland and of questionable freshness. No flavors, not even salt, was able to be infused into the meat. French onion soup was executed really poorly. All but 1/2 ounce of liquid had been reduced down to just a salty slurry. The flavors hinted at the potential, but alas it was a failure. Cote de Boeuf was not good. It was overcooked by at least two degrees of doneness, which should have been apparent when they sliced it for us. The flavors itself weren't very inspiring either, just loaded with crushed peppercorns. For $120, it should at least be mediocre. I certainly would not trust them with guests I am entertaining, but I might give them another shot down the road. Hope it was just an off night."

I can see the artists' hands creating your circle.  They are masseuses for taste buds in waiting. The payoff comes first to my smell, soon after my taste. It is obvious the love they put into their food. Very likely reinforced by the closeness of the entire experience; diners and cooks sharing the 50x25 space. I love the transparency and the togetherness this creates. In creating a metaphor relative to a pizza pie, it's not a circle that goes from restaurateur to patron and back around, it's the insides, the centers of a Lucali pie; we are a mix of ingredients together in the same space, overlapping, emphasizing each other's uniqueness; creators, consumers, purveyors, all coexisting in a warm slop of sensual goodness."

I guess because I make them at home I had an idea of what to expect and it was not that at all.  These were not baked and crisped up at all and tasted like they had no seasoning.  It seemed like they were steamed or boiled.  Maybe this is how people like them... but I wasn't a fan.

In an era where every west Brooklyn neighborhood has 25000 artisanal pizza places, I'm not sure the pizza quality alone is sufficient to justify the trip / wait / price. But: This is probably the best date place in the city. The lighting, the service (hectic no reservation policy notwithstanding), and the music just give it kind of a romantic magic that's hard to beat. And the BYOB is just so clutch - drinking fancy wine or fancy beer at market prices in this kind of environment is just hella rare in NYC, and more than compensates for the rather inflated pizza prices. If you're in a teetotaling phase, then yeah this place is pricey pizza, but otherwise, it's just so reasonable for this region of Brooklyn. As for the pizza itself - it's tasty. Very thin crust, very fresh ingredients, very good sauce. Pro tip: the no reservations policy + this place's reputation make things dicey. So either: go on a slow day (e.g. when it's cold as balls on a Wednesday night) OR call in advance at like 7:00 pm, tell them you're down to be seated whenever, they'll tell you to expect a call at like 10:00, you hop on the subway and trek down to their hood, get some snacks so you aren't cranky, pick up wine/beer to exploit the BYOB, and then settle at a local bar awaiting a phone call.

They need to go back to the drawing board on these.   4) BEEF RIBS- Flavorful like the beef brisket, but not as enjoyable because the skin was a bit too tough & the meat under it was a bit rough in certain sections & unflavorful.  This indicates that either the meat was overcooked, or cooked a while ago & kept warm, to the point where it dried out. They also sell you like a 1/2 pound bone with the meat, & the portions are usually at least 2 pounds..So at 25-30 dollars a pound, (or whatever exactly they're charging for it -don't quite remember) it's totally not worth it to shell out at least $50 for a piece of meat with a Flintstones-sized bone attached to it. SIDES: 1) MAC & Cheese-  Creamy & enjoyable, although one time I tried it, the cheddar cheese was watery because they ran out & were rushing it out of the kitchen. 2) Backyard potato salad-  Very uneventful..Tasted as if it were store-bought. 3) Baked cornbread- Delicious but reminded me of something in Greek cuisine which is considered a dessert,  instead of real baked cornbread.  As a point of comparison, I use ""John Brown Smokehouse"" 's cornbread-casserole as the gold-star measuring point for what real cornbread should taste like.                                               PRICEWISE: In general, the place seemed quite pricey, compared to what I've spent at other quality bbq joints..At least $70 flew out of my pocket each time, paying for two (no drinks), while not getting a whole lot of quantity, and a limited amount of very good quality,compared to what my expectations were. From my other experiences @ quality bbq joints, the ballpark figure for food for 2 should be around $40-50 (not including drinks) Another thing that irked me was the cheap quality plastic utensils..I understand if your theme is on-the-go bbq on a paper sheet, & metal tray .. but the cheapie knives they provide don't cut into the meat very easily.. The forks also make you feel like  you should be eating  kindergarten food instead of bbq.  They could have at least upgraded to heavier duty plastic utensils.. SUGGESTIONS: To save you a lot of aggravation & money, in these tough economic times, if you're going here for the first time & are reading these Yelp comments for suggestions, as I usually do, you are probably hungry.  Grab a couple of slices of the moist brisket (hopefully, it's moist that day), a large mac & cheese & a cornbread..This should hit the spot & do the trick , while keeping your wallet intact. Honestly, with so many other quality BBQ joints out there, I would altogether skip this place, unless you happen to be in Red Hook..On average, I spend about $45 for food for 2 at a quality place like ""John Brown's""  but somehow end up spending $70+ here..Either this place is overpriced, or the guy weighing the meat or the other guy behind the register are applying fughazy math when tallying things up."

It took about 30-45 minutes to be seated, not too bad for 8:00 on a Thursday night. As it's been said before, the service was amazing. Our waiter was super fantastic, always refilling our water, and he got our order absolutely perfect -- which is a feat for me because I order my steaks VERY rare: red with a cold center. But more on that later. He didn't treat us differently because we were a group of girls in our early 20s who are clearly not the wealthiest people ever. Really great. Put up with our questions like how big certain dishes were and how much sodas cost, etc. Our second waiter was also absolutely lovely, and when he saw that we were laughing hysterically and taking pictures of each other, he came by to ask if we wanted him to take a picture of us and he took a few, just to make sure there was one we liked. As for the food, oh my god. We started out with the goat cheese and onion tart, which was unbelievably delicious. It came with a small little salad on the side that had delicious dressing on it as well. The free bread is also very good. Two of us had the Steak Frites steak, maitre d butter style, and I don't think I can put into words how good the steak was. It was cooked to perfection, which is something a lot of steak places don't necessarily want to do for me because they don't realize I mean it when I say COLD RED CENTER. The butter did not melt one bit on my steak. It was just an absolutely beautiful piece of meat. My friend loved hers as well. I had the mashed potatoes with mine, and they were some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. They were so full of butter they practically melted in my mouth. I couldn't finish them, and my two friends devoured them once I was done. Their fries were also some of the best I've ever had, so it's a tough call when trying to decide on your potato side. The other person with us ordered the chicken something-or-other (sorry, too lazy to look; it had mushrooms and potatoes and bacon), and that was just fabulous as well. We ended the night with the creme brulee, which was big enough and rich enough for all three of us to share. It wasn't the best creme brulee I've ever had, but it was really, really effing good. This place is not cheap, but if you have the funds or want a special night, it is well worth the splurge. Also, at the end of our meal, I looked over a few tables away and said, ""That woman looks a lot like Brooke Shields."" That's because it WAS Brooke Shields. If it's good enough for Brooke, it's good enough for me."

You start off with some fried eggs at your table. Not sure why, but they always cook it so well. I usually start off with the live octopus. It's something that I always have when I'm in Korea so I try to order it anytime I see it on a menu. I think the seafood hot pot is a must. This is where the group comes into play because if you try to finish between 2 people, there's going to be a lot to take home afterward. And the best part is when they make fried rice in the hop pot after your done with the contains of the of pot. I love their spicy squid/octopus stir fry in a pumpkin bowl. The pumpkin goes well with the seafood mix and slightly sweet. The best think after the meal is the cucumber water as dessert. It's so simple, yet so good."

I am always on the lookout for amazing pizza places and New York City is fortunately not short on this. My friend and I dined at Luzzos twice. While I enjoyed my meals there both times I have to say that I enjoyed my first experience there slightly more which could be attributed to how the pizza was cooked along with the menu selections we made. The first time we dined there my friend and I split the Arugula salad which was simple yet delicious with fresh arugula and tomatoes. Next, we split an order of meatballs which were tender and tasty and topped with the most delicious sauce. I wanted to eat this sauce by the spoonful, that is how delicious I thought it was. Next, after much thought we ordered the pizza with broccoli rabe and sausage which is our favorite food combination...Simply Delicious! The crust was cooked perfectly and while the toppings were plentiful it didn't weight down the pizza. The crust was light yet durable enough to withhold the toppings. We left very happy and I found myself daydreaming about this place and my return. On to our second visit. We ordered the fried calamari to start. You could say we are a bit of calamari snobs and this didn't measure up. The fried calamari was extremely chewy to the point that we couldn't chew or swallow it. We explained the situation to the waiter and he was very nice and understanding and allowed us to try a new appetizer. We then ordered our second choice which was the fried eggplant, which was perfect.  Then we split the special pasta of the day which was pesto with shrimp and the margarita pizza. The pasta was amazing and we cleaned up that plate quite nicely. The pizza was just OK this time and I attribute that to a burnt crust. However, the sauce was just as delicious as I remember it. Overall, I really like this place as do most others due to the reviews I have read and the fact that this place is always crowded. I will definitely come back when I am craving a great pizza with sausage and broccoli rabe and some tomato sauce on the side!"

Say, which borough it's in or how esoteric it is. Lucali is an amazing pizza shop. I've been to many in Brooklyn, from the greasy slice place in every neighborhood to the high, mighty and gourmet emporia of more recent days (this is closer to the latter) where a pie costs twice what it should and the wait is thrice as long as any normal person should stand around to eat what used to be peasant food. OK, that was a bitchy way to start. Sorry, back to Lucali... Their pizza is really good - It's all fresh mozzarella-type with rustic, almost gourmet bread-quality crust (maybe the water in Brooklyn really does make the difference). The pies are huge and they've remained very, very basic with the technique applied to the crust and to the ingredients you can have put on your pizza. There is no foie gras to be had and they left the truffle oil in their shopping cart at Eli's, where it belongs (seriously, what is with the gratuitous use of truffle oil on everything at some places in this city?). The toppings available are essentially the type you'll find at many typical New York City pizza places - Basic, occasionally necessary and all very enjoyable (you know, pepperoni, peppers, mushrooms, etc.). The pies are all made to order and there's a certain old-fashioned and clearly authentic element to them that I appreciate. The menu is otherwise limited with some small appetizer and/or calzone-related offerings (the calzone was very good, by the way), although the pizza is what it's all about. The shop itself is essential Old Brooklyn to me. I think it was a former luncheonette/general store-type thing because of the remnants of old lighting, signs, shelves, and the old awning outside that all point toward that. Very (very!) dimly lit with exposed brick and cramped beyond belief, it does not belie its location in Carroll Gardens, which I always think of as a relatively old-school neighborhood anyway. This is, however, by no means a neighborhood hang-out. I am told that pizza enthusiasts come from far-and-wide to dine here, and the crowd is certainly diverse. The wait staff is an assortment of adorable locals with a good deal of enthusiasm. They're extremely friendly and accommodating (even with diners who ask too many questions and/or can't make up their mind), and I think that in itself adds a certain quality element to the place. Lucali is also BYOB, which is a nice touch (they'll uncork your bottle and provide you glasses), so you can bring your own Montepulciano (or Franzia...) to please. The only problem I have with this place is the fact that they have limited hours and don't take reservations. Of course, neither of those is limited to Lucali itself, but indulge me while I regale you with tales of the time we were more-or-less told that they're too good for reservations. I am confounded. Bad enough that they have a very limited amount of seats, but when we cheekily inquired with the owner/""pizzaiolo"" (a k a the guy flipping the dough) about this policy, the answer became clear. Owning a popular restaurant in South Brooklyn (it used to be called that, my father tells me) that serves food that follows fad allows restauranteurs and chefs to give self-importance a new meaning.... and while serving pizza (like I said, former/current (?) peasant food!). ""You've come a long way, baby!"" Highly recommended."

It's an Israeli restaurant through and through and a good one at that! We recently frequented this place for brunch and it was delicious. The menu is odd in that a majority of the brunch offerings are just $14. Dishes include Eggs Benedict in 3 styles (Classic, Salmon and Florentine), various omelettes, a Mediterranean Crispy Dough (aka Malawach), and more.  There are other items on the menu as well for an additional cost. My choice was the Burekas breakfast described as ""Puffed pastry pocket stuffed with feta & olives, served with two eggs (any style), labneh cheese, Israeli salad & tahini sauce."" It came out rather quickly and was a huge portion. Thank goodness because I was starved! I ordered my eggs poached and they were perfect. The salad was perfectly seasoned and the labane was creamy and savory. The burekas were good but not amazing. They were quite dense and not as light and crispy as I'm used to having them.

Others in our group had some good looking chile relenos (stuffed poblanos with goat cheese, pine nuts, raisins, etc), vegetarian enchiladas, and grilled shrimps and scallops dish (this looked yummy) We had rice and beans for the table. All in all it was a more authentic, cozy version of Rosa Mexicano.  I appreciated the warm hospitality but I think unless you get what I got, some of the dishes could be a miss.  They do have more interesting items on the menu, like a red snapper and a roasted pork shoulder so if I came back I would try some of those. Would be fun for groups but what Mexican isn't?"

Ok, so I'm exaggerating a bit.... but I still feel like all of Louis' events remind me of some adolescent version of ""The Hangover."" Anyways, here are my notes (good AND bad) for the evening: 1. I wish the lights had been turn down lower.... it was too bright for me. If you're going for the dimmed lights effect, it better feel like a dungeon. Or a windowless basement. Get what I'm sayin'? 2. Drinks were not strong enough. Seriously I ordered 2 Long Islands consecutively and I was still standing by the end of the night. What's wrong with this picture? 3. They don't know when their own Happy Hour ends... as was proven when we were first told HH ends at 9 then at 8:30 tried to charge my friend full price. Luckily Louis pulled the manager aside like a boss and got that straightened out. 4. I got a free drink from a bartender. Yeah buddy! 5. Drunk Yelpers should not carry other drunk Yelpers on their shoulders... 6. Sitting at the large round bar is fun for people watching. And by people watching, I mean watching a bunch of your friends play wingman for your other friends and trying to pick up chicks. 7. I wish I had eaten some of those pork buns because they smelled amazing. That will be accomplished next time. 8. I don't remember who I left with exactly or what time I left. Whoops. 9. Really I'd like to give FB a 3.5 but I guess I'll be nice and round up. 10. I wish I had stayed longer to dance on top of the bar since I heard that happens late at night ""after hours""..... next time it's happening!!! Overall, I had a good time. Things were fuzzy towards the end of the evening as a few of us took the party to Sushi Lounge for a late night snack and then Manitobas for unneeded drinks. I don't know what the hell I was thinking as I lost my exit buddy Ming along the way. I didn't get home till 3 something in the morning and boy did my aunt give me crap for it the next day.... so thank you Fat Buddha for giving me an excuse to disrespect my aunt (who is driving me insane at home)!"

It's ironic that a so-called Italian restaurant could not even make decent pastas, and we had to send them back.

I was completely shocked at how good the food and my experience was. First the food: Caviar spread - I don't remember the actual name of the dish but this reminded me of a lox spread but was much lighter and had the perfect amount of saltines to it. Excellent app. Stuffed calamari - I wasn't crazy about this dish but it was more of a preference thing. The calamari stuffing was a little bland. The salad it came with was very good though with a lemon dressing. Turkish sausage with hummus - fantastic dish. The sausage tasted like a mix of chorizo and pepperoni and was great. Ate it with the hummus on some bread. Lamb chops - entree sized tapas, the lamb was perfectly cooked medium rare and the roasted vegetables were unbelievable. We also had good turkish wine and bread with olives. For dessert, we had this dark chocolate ganache brownie thing with ice cream and turkish cotton candy. Let me say that I am not a dessert person, but this was really good. The location itself was pretty nice with an intimate downstairs room and an outdoor seating area. I think there was an upstairs as well but I didn't go up. The workers there were great and even gave us a complimentary glass of sangria at the end of the meal which was very refreshing. You can see how much we ate and drank, and even after that, our bill was just over $100 including a healthy tip. I will definitely be back and I recommend that you do the same."

Waiter verbalized understanding and yet when the main entree came out, the waiter said that it didn't come with mash. Well duh! that's why we asked to have it substituted with something else.... and if there was a separate charge, we would have been more than happy to pay it because that's what we wanted. So that was weird!  Sunday night was especially busy (maybe people had off for Columbus Day) but we waited a long time for out appetizers, could;t understand why: 2 cups of Lobster Bisque and Lobster Mac and Cheese.  I also noticed that I ordered salmon and that was supposed to come with mash, and yet it didn't.  I didn't want to argue it so just left it alone.

I would've given Yuca Bar 5 stars if it weren't for the loud ass music. Initially the music they had playing had us singing and wanting to get up and dance.

I brought my mother here to celebrate her birthday.  I informed the restaurant, and we were treated like royalty from start to finish! We toasted with champagne to begin and enjoyed a delicious fried artichoke appetizer, a house specialty.   While it appears that choosing different antipasto plates here is standard practice of many diners, we opted out, as we did not want to fill up before our meals.   I specifically brought my mother here because her favorite meal is veal parmesan, and I knew that this establishment had one of the best chops around. My mother is a very tough sell when it comes to food.  She could not stop saying how delicious the veal was!  She was truly in heaven with the dish.  The veal portion is huge -- easily can be split between at least two people!  My mother could not even finish half.   I ordered the whole branzino, while was accompanied with roasted butternut squash, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and roasted cipollini onions.  I was in the mood for something on the lighter side and was very pleased.  I also had sauteed spinach on the side, which was delicious. We were greeted with cookies and limoncello before the dessert, which was another sweet touch.  As for dessert we split a key lime pie which completed the dinner beautifully.

Before heading to the movies, a friend and I wanted to grab a quick bite. We were debating between crepes and arepas, but the outdoor seating at Cafe Triskell helped us make our decision. The owners (I'm assuming) were so nice and charming, making sure we felt comfortable and giving recommendations on the menu. We opted to split the escargot and we each got our own crepes to split. The escargot was a nice start to the meal. I've only had it a few times, but it's never been a poor choice. Cafe Triskell's wasn't bad, but it was less buttery than I would've thought. It tasted like it was cooked in olive oil more so than butter. I did however appreciate the tomato and bacon chunks throughout. The starter bread that came out made for a good pairing. The coiled ones reminded me of a crustier, more buttery croissant. Our crepes were unfortunately a little underwhelming. While ordering, we asked our server if they could be made a meal of, to which he confirmed. It was definitely a lot smaller than I expected when it came out. My cream of spinach and chicken crepe, while tasty, was very deflated. My friend's goat cheese and chicken was much more full-looking. We split each others' crepes, and we both agreed the goat cheese was definitely better. Size aside, the goat cheese provided a much creamier, full-body flavor than the cream of spinach. Also, the chicken was much more pronounced and you could actually taste the meat you were eating. With the cream of spinach, it was all chopped and mixed together into a mush. This is definitely a cute little cafe to drop in on. The food is hit or miss, but because it's not unreasonably priced, it's not a bad choice to try on a lazy Saturday afternoon."

Forgot what I ordered for the first time, but the memory did prompt me to try out again when I'm in Williamsburg with a mood for udon. Their homemade papa dressing in mama salad tastes familiar yet special, giving gourmet dabblers like me an illusion that I can find the dressing in any market. White rice and eels with yuzu juice wrapped by crispy seaweed on the seasonal menu delighted me, especially there are three options of sauces which are according to the spicy level by adding more or less wasabi. Tender and stuffed, the delicate eel sushi was literally devoured by me in two bites. Here comes the leading role: Kinokojil kake udon, which is a soup udon with assorted cooked mushrooms. Honestly speaking, it was a bit disappointing. The soup tastes simply as a considerate proportion of soy sauce and water.There's neither wrongness with assorted mushrooms, nor surprise. My friend's pork curry udon was better. I feel like any dish served with their homemade sauce worths expectation somehow. The matcha cocktail is a highlight - by saying that, I still signify neutral. People prefer harder liquor may like it, because it was made by Japanese shochu, so it's really strong, even if its flavor is matcha-based, which is supposed to be light and refreshing; But no matter how much green tea soy milk and powder that they've put in, as long as the basic liquor is a hard one, then...you've got to really think it through before you completely succumb to your curiosity. Wooden furnitures and dilapidated walls gave you a sense of security and authenticity as long as you step in. Back room which across their counter and cupboard area is more quiet.

But, a good macaron is a good macaron and this girl doesn't discriminate so when I was gifted a box of Ladurée macarons from a weekend in New York, I definitely did not complain. Although Ladurée has a storefront in New York City, they actually make all of their macarons in Paris and then ship them over. Talk about a commitment to quality! And it would probably explain the hefty markup. After paying for the name, the airfare, and then the crushed macarons in the process, you'll end up paying a pretty penny for these beauties. So are they worth it? Well that would really depend on you. My boyfriend brought me back a good assortment of flavors: pistachio, coffee, vanilla, raspberry, strawberry candy, salted caramel, black current violet just to name a few and I have made my way through a considerable number of them. While the macarons are definitely very pretty and colorful with well-formed feet and full shells (talk about technique), the flavors are a bit...lacking for better words. My favorite flavor by far was the strawberry candy because it tasted unique but as for the other flavors, they were definitely a lot more muted than the Pierre Hermé. I really don't think I would buy another Ladurée macaron just for myself to fix a craving, but the brand name and the experience is definitely a novelty, so it is a good gift idea. And with such a price tag, it'd better be a gift for an extremely expensive person."

BEST RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD (kidding...sort of) This place has never failed to please. Service, food, location; all outstanding. Been many, many times; sometimes for socializing with friends over drinks, sometimes for brunch, sometimes for dinner. And, honestly, each time we leave we realize we shouldn't wait so long to come back. Lately we've become regulars for Sunday brunch, so we're reaching our goals. Note: Brunch is only served on Sunday mornings. Service is great from the moment we walk in the door. Always greeted with a smile, there is a spot to leave your umbrella if it happens to be raining, and rarely a long wait for a table. Ambiance and decor are inviting, warm, casual, and fitting with the neighborhood. For brunch, the best things we've had are the buckwheat pancakes and the monte cristo; both incredible, hearty portions, always satisfying. For dinner, we love the burger and scallops; and our friends tell us the bowl of mussels is great, too. For either meal, the fries here are really great; crispy, light, and perfect every time. Every drink we've had has been great; classic bloody mary, mimosa, bellini, and the Long Bottom Bramble from their signature cocktail list is one of the best drinks we've had in the city. If you're in the neighborhood (please leave...jk), and want a great place to sit, relax, and enjoy great food & libations, this is the spot. You will not be disappointed.

Loved the vibe, crowd and most of the food. Had the shrimp toast and crab croquette and shrimp rolls because it was Good Friday and the Catholics in our group were not eating meat. One non-observant among us had the wings, which was the most generous plate of the night. She pronounced it the best. I found the drinks to be a tad sweet, but again some in our group loved them. For half price during happy hour--totally worth it. I have to come back here for the wings and BBQ meats, because they are personal favorites of mine. I thought the crab croquette had a very mushy texture, bot others liked them. The shrimp toast was delicious and new to our crowd, but I think they're a throwback too the 60s.

The non-Korean dishes fare significantly better.  My corn soup was excellent and the duck was tasty, but the portion was ridiculously huge.  I would have been happy with half the dish at a lower price point.  My boyfriend had the pork tenderloin and his experience was the same: too much food, good but not particularly excellent.

Any who, I didn't want to deal with the crowded club scene this year, just wanted a laid-back spot. I called two weeks beforehand and made reservations with a girl named Gin. It was quick and easy and surprisingly they didn't take credit card info which some places tend to do. I reserved their biggest table for about 20 people at 8pm on a Friday. When we got there the table was perfectly set up and they even let me bring balloons (yes, I wanted balloons) :) Those of us who got there before 9pm were able to take advantage of the happy hour (although we were seated at the table). I quickly ordered pork buns and wings for everyone and it came out fairly quickly. One of the bartenders sent over free shots for everyone which was really nice of him. Around 1030pm they begin to remove all the tables and create a dance floor by DJ. They played a mix of everything but mostly Hip-Hop. It was definitely a lot if fun and we ended dancing for the rest of the night. My only negatives are that the lychee martinis were pretty weak. My friends kept buying me drinks and I was still perfectly fine after about 7. I should've been done after 3! Also, they removed all our bags and coats from the couches without asking! They take them to coat check but still...freaking let us know! Other than that great time and staff was excellent."

Perfect crispy skin, combined somehow with unbelievably moist meat. Just wow. My wife enjoyed a pasta special which was also quite good, though for the life of me I can't remember the details of it, as wrapped up in chicken as I was. We sat outside on a beautiful cool summer evening, and if I were to give the restaurant a ding, I'd say, hey Marlow and Sons, how about a little elbow room in between tables.

First, woodside is a culinary hotbed. There is nothing you cannot find up there. Super diverse community in general and it is not unlike the United Nations barfed all over the area and out came China-men, Mexicans, I-talians, old Poles, regular white people and a few Jew-guys. To say the least it is hard to focus in on a type of food, never mind a specific place, to eat. So thumbing through the Yelp spots I came upon Fresca and, as I was with my Wife, who is particularly partial to the crepe, our destination was presented, and agreed on. I dropped a quick tip when I checked in and it is simply this, there is no parking available. FLC (Fresca La Crepe) is steps from pretty major rail and bus hubs, so while meters and parking spots exist, its all taken. I found a quiet dead end road a block and a half away and parked in a mighty illegal fashion. Fuck the Police! When you walk to FLC the place is unassuming and pretty light, to nonexistent, on seating. But remember, commerce in this sector is almost entirely driven by the strap hangers and locals. In other words we are not in Starbucks anymore so the expectation is that you would order your food, catch the 7:15 bound for Penn. and/or go home up the block and two streets over. The order. As you walk in the counter is directly to your right and above that is the menu boards done up in chalk. There are three boards to select from; board one offers ""sweet crepes"", we got the butter and sugar and a variation of the banana/nutella, which had raspberries as well. Board two ""savory crepes"", from here I tried the omelet crepe which had eggs, mushrooms, sauteed onions, ham and cheddar. It was that or the baby spinach with feta crepe for me. There a few others to choose from. Another Yelper snagged and posted a pic of the menu so check that for the exacts. Board three was coffee selections. No coffee for us this time. First the butter and sugar crepe: spot on, simple, fair amount of butter for taste and the right amount of powder sugar. The difference between this one and others I have had was the mix of the crepe itself, which was very light and absent was any scorching and/or oil residue. Scorching is my trademark, when I had made them at home long ago, and it makes the crepe bitter. The oil residue would be the opposite effect of those who have scorched and have now over compensated in greasing and in so doing produced a super heavy, after taste laden sog of a coffee filter looking thing. No, these were light and subdued with a delicate flavor. Best crepe I have had in a long time. The banana/nutella w/ raspberries used the same crepe as the butter and sugar so the comments generally apply here in the same way. Now, the savory crepe was a very hearty combination of the ingredients and pretty delicious . The biggest issue I had was that it did not fill me up! Probably not FLC's fault though as I am a big man Sponge Bob.  A very big man! My bottom line is this; food = good, atmosphere = subdued bustle, on the reg? = when I am in Woodside and am on the crepe crave"

Despite the back room being mostly empty the hostess sat us right in the middle at a 2-top, so everyone picking up their orders would pass by us. We were asked to move and were reseated graciously. We ordered an Ovest and a Martha, and two glasses of house red. The Ovest was my favorite; spicy salami, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce. The Martha was pretty tasty with prosciutto and truffle oil and mozzarella, but I prefer a little sauce on my pizza. Plus, it seemed oily rather than truffley. The crust looked a little charred but both were chewy and crisp and perfectly thin. The wine was perfect. All total it was about $59 plus tip.

The meat here is always cooked so it remains juicy and tender... but the panko breading is never soggy or oily.

There is enough rice and curry along with the katsu so that completing the whole dish is a filling accomplishment!

Our waiter took our order and made some good suggestions as he realized that we were ordering way too much food for just the two of us and suggested a combo that was better suited for our needs. He was right... there was a lot of food. I give this place 3 stars because despite the fact that you get a lot of food (for a good price) there were some minor issues. We ordered diet coke and it didn't taste very good, very watered down and the server had warned us about it in advance but it tasted more like carbonated water. The seafood was good, but some shellfish still had sand in it and some of the mussels still had large pieces of string still attached to them (because they came from a mussel farm). It isn't uncommon to see that, but it didn't add anything to the experience. You definitely get your moneys worth here and the staff and atmosphere are great. I think the food is a matter of opinion and the kind of mood you are in. If you just come with friends to chill or a late night out after clubbing or bar hopping this is definitely the place to hit.

But this particular place seems to have managed to remain classy, fun, consistently good, and one of my favorites for years now. I am slightly biased (I will be honest here) since this is practically my neighborhood watering hole and I live about ten blocks away. Nevertheless, I always enjoy my time there no matter who is with me. I also must confess that I rarely sit at a table for I find the wait to be ludicrous and the quarters a bit too cramped. I prefer to sit at the bar(!)-I know I just said that I didn't like the sardine factor of table seating and one would assume it is the same, if not worse, at the bar. But I do not mind sipping my martini while waiting for space to clear, which it always does. My other bias here comes from the fact that I enjoy sitting at the bar partly because of the bartenders. They are all friendly and very good at their jobs, but one of them (shout out to Matthew!) is a friend of mine and personally sees to it that I get a spot and my drink is made before I can even speak. That being said, I have been there on nights when he hasn't been working and have still immensely enjoyed myself. It is great fun to chat with all the bartenders, for most of them have wicked senses of humor (much like myself) and some (another shout out to Matthew) are so dry and sarcastic that you can enjoy a sparring match with your cocktail. It's like dinner theater, but better. The interior is as gorgeous as it always has been and the feeling I get when I am there is that I have been transported to another city (rhymes with Schmaris). The food is really good (goat cheese tart is utterly delicious, as is, according to my friend, the duck Shepherd's pie) and they have good wine for moderate prices. Yes, it can get extremely crowded and yes, it can be a pick up spot (especially if you are a woman sitting at the bar, no matter if you have a man, bf or otherwise, with you). But I have met great people there and a few of them are friends of mine now. I met these people just by sitting at the bar, chatting with them about nyc, or their food, or whatever else came to mind. That is the kind of experience you can look forward to by walking through their doors-great food, good wine, fantastic and attentive service, and the prospect of meeting someone interesting and exciting. I think that is called something rare-a bargain. this is a post script-I traveled to paris during the summer 2007. Balthazar is completely Parisian and as lovely as any place that I had the luck to visit last summer. I do not speak french so anyone who does can translate the following statement-""magnificent""."

Luckily for me I was allowed to share that experience with my fiance and his family for Christmas lunch. We arrived about half an hour before our reservation time (1pm), and were unable to to be seated. It was fine because it gave us time to take some pictures with the lovely Christmas decor. The hostess offered to take our jackets and the bartenders offered us beverages while we waited. We were seated and offered their four course prix fixe Christmas menu. When taking our drink order the waiter asked us several times if we wanted flat or sparkly. I think he asked my fiance 3-4 times before finally getting it. I ordered the lobster soup, pork shoulder ravioli, poached lobster, and the peppermint ice cream/gelato for dessert. Lobster soup came with about 4 small pieces of lobster, which was expected for places like this. Flavor was rich and creamy. Ravioli came with about 5-6 pieces. It was ridiculously SALTY and dry looking. Definitely did not look like it was made in house. I had to force myself to finish the last piece because I hate wasting food. The other people in my party also agreed their dishes were way over salted and complained to our waiter. He said that they tend to use alot of salt in their dishes and would ask the chef to use less in our main course. The best dish was probably the poached lobster tail. It wasn't too salty, and it came out very tender. The peppermint gelato was good, but a little too sweet for my liking. My fiance ordered the lemon custard that had a few fingerprints in the middle. You could clearly see the ridges of the person's fingers. We asked the waiter for a new one. He apologized and assured us that all the kitchen staff wear gloves when preparing the food.  They said they would get a new one, but it looked like they scraped off the top of it. Although the staff were professional and accommodating, they all seemed lifeless with no personality. There were just a few small details in their presentation of the food and clean up that seemed a little sloppy to me. My fiance pointed out that they had to work on Christmas day, and there was nothing to be happy about. Even so, you still have to keep in mind that you have to behave a certain way at work.

The space was cute, the food was great, the portions were huge, and each course came out in nicely spaced intervals. I just had to take away a star for the service. I came here on a Friday night with reservations and was seated right away. Our waiter was pleasant enough and told us about their stuffed calamari appetizer special. Um, but how come a few minutes after we ordered, a different waiter told the table next to us about five other appetizer specials, and at least three entree specials? Whatever. At the end of the day, we were still pretty happy with our selection. The marinated artichoke hearts were well-seasoned and refreshing, the eggplant parmigiana looked a bit more like a pizza/flatbread than we'd expected but was tasty, the lobster cannelloni did not disappoint and my friend was pleased with her eggplant rollatini. The tiramisu was damn good, as was the spumoni tartufo. The creme brûlée had more of a pudding-like consistency but I'm not mad; after all, it's not a French restaurant. The biggest issue with the service came at the end when our waiter literally interrupted our conversation as we were finishing our wine to say, ""Just so you know, there are a people waiting for the table,"" accompanied with a ""Let's wrap it up here"" hand gesture. Never mind the table next to ours that had been empty for the past 15 minutes. I'm sorry, but that's not my problem. We had a reservation and you don't have a table time limit and we weren't even lingering. Sure, it's one thing to apologetically make us aware of the situation using a tactful ""whenever you're ready,"" but it's a whole different issue to flat out tell us to hurry it up and make it a point to reach over us and begin clearing our table right after we hand over a $180 bill with a 22% tip. At the end of the day this wasn't a total deal breaker - everyone has their off days and I can always give someone the benefit of the doubt. I'll probably give this place another try eventually because the food was good and the other waiter seemed much better but this really wasn't the best first impression, especially after reading all the glowing reviews prior to this experience."

Lucali's...  Despite It's little known existence just three year's ago, the establishment and operations of Mr. Mark Ianoco has gained such notoriety that it's patron base rivals that of many of New York's highly renowned Pizzerias.  To visit Lucali's is to understand it's Pizza offerings, to dine at Lucali's to be truly humbled. Rachel and I arrived at Lucali's on a Saturday evening at 6:00pm on a spontaneous endeavor.  We began to put our name on the waitlist and was informed that the wait would be 1 hour.  Not too bad given the high recognition given this establishment, thus we proceeded to walk around Carroll Gardens. --- 45 Minutes Later --- We received a call stating that our table was ready.  We immediately rushed back to Lucali's in less than 3 minutes to meet our table obligations. At first entry, patrons will find that the vibrant yet romantic décor of Lucali's is one that's best described as breathtaking and humbling.  With it's rich ivory white walls that's amplified solely by candlelight, the restaurant itself provides a truly romantic feel.  Compared to most other establishments, Lucali's is lit solely by candlelight.  There's no fluorescent tungsten lightening or spotlights from above, the lighting is solely provided by what little sunlight shining through the windows and that of the individual candle placements on each table.  To further describe the establishment, the furniture at Lucali's is comprised of old rustic wooden material, thus aiding in the simplistic feel.  To the immediate back of the restaurant, Mr. Ianoco works under candle lighting to create the various offerings selected by patrons.  With his station finely controlled to his attention, and his patrons under the care of his watchful eye, a feeling of being at home is rendered when dining at Lucali's.  All patrons first entering are greeted by Mr. Ianoco from afar, which aids in the calming tones that surrounds ones sense.  Simply put, the feeling of Lucali's is one that's at ease.  Perhaps Mr. Ianoco's attempt to create an ambient yet peasantry environment worked to his delight, as the quaint and tranquil feel while dining at his establishment is simply superb. The Food:  Great Mastery of Technique, Remarkable Pizza. The Pizza:  A thinly piece of naturally leavened dough is topped with a warm coating of San Marzano Tomato Sauce, and topped with a special three cheese blend.  After removal from the brick oven, the pizza is finished off with a drizzle of Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Fresh Basil, and a Sprinkling of Parmigiano Reggiano.  When consuming Pizziaolo Ianoco's rendition of a classic Naples export, the various flavors derived from his offering is observed as uncanny.  The first notable detection in the Pizza is the nicely charred dough crust that sets the foundation for all the flavors.  The mildly sweet yet hearty taste of the San Marzano tomatoes are amplified by the three cheese base topping.  What's remarkable the three cheese base is Mark Ianoco's ability to deliver an initial velvetty sweet flavor from the Fresh Mozzarella that transitions remarkably well to a slightly bitter and coarse flavor (similar to that of La Tur, but certainly not La Tur).  The Pizza is then finished by a mildly salty / sharp finish of the sprinkling of Parmigiano Reggiano that's balanced out the freshness of the Basil.  When the flavors of the various ingredients combined together, the four detectable flavors on the tongue (Sweet, Sour, Salt, and Bitter), are all enticed, thus allowing for each of the various ingredients of Mr. Ianoco's creation to shine both individually and on conjunction.  A simply remarkable well execution of a classic Naples export! To understand Lucali's is to understand the ideology behind The Pizziaolo, Mark Ianoco's, mastery!  Peasantry atmosphere, that's accompanied by over the top ingredients used to create his pizza is what Lucali's is.  With a fixed menu of two items, Lucali's provides what's good, and what's most sought after.  Simply put, the Pizza is not to be overlooked, but rather embodied and appreciated with each and every bite. Notes on Lucali's: - Set Menu:  Pizza: $26.00 - Toppings are based on what Lucali's has available. - Cash Only!  ATMs are hard to find in the neighborhood so bring cash before arriving. - BYOB.  Bring your own bottle of wine to enjoy the occasion. - If you're the jealous type then don't bring the girlfriend.  Significant others have been known to stare at Mr. Ianoco for hours on end. - Wait time can vary between 10 minutes to 2 hours.  Lucali's allows patrons to call ahead and put their names on the wait list. - No reservations, but patrons can call ahead of seating"

Service was very good. Decor was outstanding. Very cool. Prices were OK. With all the hype I guess we were a little underwhelmed, but it's still a fine place to eat."

I had one with paneer and another with chicken. Both were pretty good. Although I asked for them to be mild, I still found them to be a little spicy but that is probably just my intolerance to spicy stuff more than anything else. I think it should be fine for most people. The rolls take a little time to come out and you can see them rolling each one so they appear to be pretty fresh. The paratha that the filling is inside is really good. Not a whole lot of seating but around dinner time on a Friday, we were still able to get a table.

We walked in on a Thursday night around 8:30, I know pretty much prime time, and wanted to get a seat at the bar. Granted it was crowded but we practically had to throw ourselves at the bartender to get his attention, then when we ordered, he got our drink order totally wrong. My date ordered a Manhattan and a kettle soda and he gives us a Cosmo? My date looks at me and says "" now I know I didn't order a Cosmo because it's not even in my vocabulary"" snap! The one good thing the bartender did is put us on a mental list to get the next 2 bar stools that were free. We waited about 30 minutes and as a couple gets up to leave some smarmy JA tries to slide in on our stools. The bartender tells him we're waiting and he proceeds to tell his date to just ignore us and sit down. Really? Take your kelly green cords and hit road you DB. We got our seats. We decided to order some oysters and again, the bartender was not very helpful. We went with 6 of the kumumoto's and 6 of the wellfleets...delish! I know 1/2 dozen of the blue points go for $21 so I'm thinking we're talking a good $36 + for the dozen we ordered...fail. Next we tried to order an entree, resort again to body throwing across bar. We decided to split the steak frites and although it was good, the frites and the bearnaise sauce were awesome, I don't think it's worth $36. Anyone that follows my posts knows that I do a lot of fine dining so I'm not a cheap ass, I just think you should get what you pay for. Balthazar is a total tourist trap and although I've been there many times for many different meals, always at the suggestion of someone else, I've never bought into the hype.

Maybe it's because Obao easily seats 3x the amount of customers as some of the other places that makes it always seem half-full. But that means you almost never need a reservation or to wait to be seated. Diehard pho fans will probably disagree, but I think Obao offers a solid bowl of pho, and not just because there are limited competitors in the area. The broth is packed with flavor without being overly salty, and it comes with a generous serving of sliced and braised beef. They also bring you a bottle of hoisin sauce and Sriracha so you can personalize to your tastes. I've also found they're not afraid to turn up the heat.

We started with the asparagus soup and  fried goat cheese with raspberries, prosciutto and honey. The soup was just delightful and no smelly pee-pee either ;) . In all honesty the cheese sounded better than it actually tasted but it was a nice unique appetizer.   For the main course we went with the smoked leg of lamb with fava beans and cavolo nero and sautéed fluke  with marinated mushrooms pea puree and lambs quarters. Both main dishes were utterly divine, of exceptional quality, truly unique and enjoyable. Apps and a main course came to about $50.00 per person with tip so consider accordingly.

The room seemed to be buzzing from that excitement. Our experience was very positive and we left feeling that the review was mostly justified. We were greeted warmly and seated in the main room. The room feels light and spacious and there is a good amount of space between the tables. Our waiter was warm and convivial and did not steer us wrong all night. We started with a few appetizers, all of which succeeded incredibly well. The Pea soup was refreshing and flavorful; the Carozza was lightly fried and very tasty. The polenta was the most incredible of the 3. It comes presented in a small white bowl with a steel pot of wild mushrooms on the side. The two are mixed together in front of you and it is truly magical. I could have eaten another serving of it right away. Our waiter suggested a rose from Montepulciano to match with the appetizers and it went brilliantly. We then split an order of the spaghetti with tomato and basil for the table. It was rich and flavorful with a little bit of a bite to it. What a treat to have fresh pasta served al dente. The main courses were the only part that did not overwhelm us. We had the Osso buco, the chicken with a liver sauce and the baby goat. They were all good but a bit overly salted. Not terrible by any means. Just a bit too much. If the first two courses had not been so spectacular, I probably would not have noticed the slight slip ups in the main courses. Desserts were really good although we were really quite full. The apple pie was spectacular with a polenta crust that tasted like very good shortbread. The Parfait came with a small milkshake that could have been enough just by itself. The Cheesecake has no cheese and was overwhelming tart. It was the least successful of the 3. The service was professional and friendly all night and the whole evening was a pleasure. We will certainly be back to try all of the pastas that looked so good (and of course to have that polenta again. ) What a great addition to the New York restaurant scene."

This place is so miniscule, but they always manage to produce a great meal. I used to come by here more often since I used to work a few blocks away, but my visit today made me realize how much I miss this place. For me, this is the quintessential description of a neighborhood gem. This place offers non fancy, rustic, well executed French food, I guess it would be considered a cafe rather than a bistro. I have always left this place happy, well done Chef Phillipe. The food: Escargot- sautéed snail, bacon, cherry tomatoes, herb butter served w/ bread. I am such a sucker for snails, they have such a nice texture and flavor, or at least it picks up the flavor it cooks in well. I would say a snail, for those who haven't tried it, is like a chewier mushroom. Ideally a snail that is cooked and served in the shell is the way to go but that is such a rare thing to see now a days, but the snails here are very good none the less. And don't forget to drown the bread in the garlic butter. nom yelp.com/user_local_phot Triskell Savory Crepes- Button mushrooms, Swiss cheese & herb butter. I really thought this combo worked well. The Swiss cheese they use here is such a high quality cheese with a great chew. The mushroom and herb butter offer a nice earthy note. Croque Madame- hot sandwich with ham, Swiss cheese, and bechamel sauce plus egg served with a side house salad and potato chips. So I was kinda tricked into believing that a ham and cheese sandwich is so boring and plain, oh no, not here it isn't. I only really ordered it since it seemed like everyone ordered it. And I can soundly say it is the greatest ham and cheese sandwich I ever ate. Period. yelp.com/user_local_phot Dessert Crepe- homemade banana and chocolate jam. Oh sweet Moses...when the crepe was served, I immediately had the ""I am going to be disappointed' feeling. Shame on me. The crepe looks very basic and the condiment is served on the side. The crepe felt more like a paper thin waffle with a hint of sweetness. The crepe was crunchy yet slightly chewy and the banana and chocolate jam was sweet but not over the top sweet.

For $7 you get 2 pieces, the size of a baguette that has been sliced. Hazelnut pesto with orange zest was OK, maybe a touch dry and salty. The seasonal heirloom tomato salad was amazing. The beet salad was also outstanding. Carrot cake was fine but nothing special. I preferred the chocolate mousse with fresh, home made whipped cream. Super rich, great for sharing. The water glasses are tiny. Evey the carafe they give you (sometimes) is miniature, and it is a bit annoying to want some water but not want to bother the waiter (who can't be found anyway) to fill the carafe for the 4th time . Bigger glasses and carafes would be nice and would give the staff one less thing to worry about. The service is uneven, from efficient and helpful to MIA.

I am a vegetarian myself, so I usually only get the grilled tofu or seitan options, which are really excellent.  The meat-eaters I know talk positively about the BBQ chicken and steak as particularly good.  This is often somewhat of a crowd-pleasing place to order from when you do have a mixed group of meat-eaters and vegetarian/vegans. We used to order this for lunch 2-3 times a week in my office, and people did find it monotonous after a while, but we still regularly order from there. I should note that I have tried a few of the non-burrito menu items, and I don't think they are particularly good.  This place does burritos, salsa and chips well. If you like extra-spicy, definitely try the green hot-sauce they offer.  It's one of the better hot-sauces I've had, and I am a bit of a connoisseur. Note that their phone system is clunky, and it can actually be difficult to get through during the lunch rush to place an order.  Try to order before 11:45AM or after 1PM on weekdays; your order will arrive much faster.  The lunch rush delay from call to delivery can be up to an hour sometimes. Finally, eating in is not really an option; it's crowded and not much seating.  Target it for carry-out or delivery."

We had a quiet time and enjoyed drinks and appetizers. At the end of the evening, I closed my tab with our bartender, Luis. I had been happy with his service and left a tip just as I would for any other bartender. As I signed the credit card slip, imagine my surprise when Luis said, in Spanish, ""Finally these f*ggots are leaving."" Rather than automatically becoming upset and defensive with Luis, which would have been a perfectly appropriate response to such a hateful statement, my boyfriend, friends, and I left after saying good night. I have learned long ago that returning hatred to someone  in such a situation does not improve the outcome of that experience. I also would not stoop down to Luis's level by continuing such hurtful dialogue. Rather, I decided to contact the manager of the restaurant the next day to make him aware of what happened. Surely, the manager could deal accordingly with his employee. Therefore,  I and a family member of mine called the manager the next day. When we explained the situation to Sergei, he automatically responded with, ""My employee would never have said something like that unless you were belligerent with him."" I explained that this simply was not the case. In fact, I left the restaurant without causing a scene, knowing it would serve no purpose. Further, even if I had not been a perfectly kind customer or was ""belligerent"", being called a f*ggot by anyone, especially by someone serving a customer, is completely inappropriate. Sergei then stated that he would speak with Luis. However,  he stated very emphatically that he did not believe Luis acted in the wrong. Unfortunately, this has led me to believe that the management at Yuca promotes a sense of hatred and exclusion. This is especially surprising given that this restaurant is located in the East Village. It is clear that even though gay individuals may enjoy marriage equality in New York, we are not truly considered equal by certain people. Therefore, I no longer feel comfortable being a customer at this institution, and I will no longer show Yuca my patronage."

An 80 bill was annoying to say the least.. I liked the atmosphere and if your a beer lover there are plenty of options -- but id skip dinner here unless your extremely hungry."

I will say that they had many options to choose from for them to shove in the oven. The pizza came out crispy with melting cheese (yum!).

I finally tried it with a group of friends and found it to be extremely disappointing. For background:  I don't work in food now. But I have and I regularly prepare foods like lamb breast and I poach eggs at home often.   We ordered 6 different dishes. 5 of them were hot food items. With the exception of the fried deviled eggs the hot food items were at absolute best warm. This shouldn't happen, period. It especially shouldn't happen on a monday when the restaurant is at 1/4 capacity. It makes me angry to pay the prices they ask for barely warm food. It really does. The fried deviled eggs (E666s) are exciting conceptually but in reality the filling gets to much heat and the dish loses the creamy goodness of a deviled egg to become something less than sum of its parts. The octopoached egg ... Perhaps the biggest disappointment. You would think this would involve a poached egg, right? Instead there was some chewy octopus with a big ol' hard boiled yolk right in the middle. hard boiled! Lots of chefs have pointed this out before, but you can tell a lot about a kitchen from how the eggs come out. Other than that the octopus was closer to cold than warm, and generally just not tasty. The grilled squid, boring, not hot, texture predominantly limp. The lamb breast was fine. Again, temperature was off but flavor was good enough. Lamb breast is inherently tasty so it's hard to ruin it.  Dish was comprised of a dry rub on some lamb breast. The beef and broccoli. Cute name, boring limp steak. It was like it was seared first and then sous vided and then just served out of the bag. I don't know if it was or wasn't but the texture is best described as soft, and the flavor was weak. Also, sigh, temperature was warmish. Overall, it reminded me of food concepts that hadn't been thought out or perfected. I found it vaguely shameful that they were putting this stuff out of their kitchen and charging 10-24 dollars a plate. If I made this food for guests, I'd feel like I failed and would be thoroughly embarrassed. Service was fine, if unremarkable. They try so hard with the precious names, why not try a little bit hard to take the food seriously?"

I've always been a big fan of Van Leeuwen ice cream, so I did have a little hope that the food will be as good as their ice cream! So I went ahead for brunch with a few girlfriends and was completely blown away!! We started with the mango mimosa (mango syrup and cava), which was very refreshing and had just the right sweetness. For our meal, being indecisive girls, we ordered 3 entrees to share: Tamarind-Glazed Tempeh Smash - sweet, savory, delicious -umami to the max! This may become a favorite!!! The tempeh was locally made and tasted ""fresh"" (not dry or too mushy) Ayam Bumbu - the chicken was crispy (not oily or greasy!) somehow it tasted just like the fried chicken from Indonesia.. Well seasoned and cooked. The squash was also a great side that came with it, great texture and flavour. The sambal tomat was unbelievable, did wish it was spicier but still very good! Market Fish Curry - Mahi Mahi was today's special and lightly fried. The one thing that impressed me about this dish is that they nailed it on making this taste like Indonesian curry (not Thai curry, not Indian curry.. BUT ACTUAL INDONESIAN CURRY!!!!)

I was surprised they didnt even have Japanese pancake on the menu...however there was a pictured item called Okonomiyaki listed. I figured I'd order it anyway, it wouldnt hurt.

I ended up with Chicken donburi and my friend ordered Pork katsu. My entree was an epic failure, the egg being pretty much fully cooked, the chicken being dry and tasteless, no sauces, no flavor.

Do or Dine, one of the contributors to Bed Stuy's resurgence as a dining destination over the past few years, is more an in-the-moment entertaining chuckle fest than a serious contender for any lasting memories or dining awards - Michelin recommendation, notwithstanding. Nevertheless, it's a charming restaurant, and oozes personality despite the plethora of contrived puns on the menu.  I think I may be more impressed with the fact that they've carried on with their schtick for over 3 years now. My first visit at Bed Stuy Do or Dine was for brunch around the Labor Day weekend. It was a good opportunity to evaluate the restaurant's credentials with a kitchen not unduly stressed by customer orders. Our meal started on a really strong note with the Foie Gras Doughnut, collaboration with the incomparable Dough bakery. The silky mousse of foie gras served with a Smuckers preserve filling and encased in a texturally perfect Dough doughnut won us over with its lightness, along with a hint of tartness. This was followed by the Shishito Quatre Sel, with yuzu, wasabi, hickory and green tea flavored salts. I know this was meant to be a simple dish, but such simple dishes can often pack an unexpectedly mean punch (the non-sequitur reference to boxing courtesy an incongruent Mohammad Ali Sonny Liston poster inside the restaurant). Not so in this case, as the wasabi flavored salt was the only one not so mellow as to be unmemorable, and the Shishito peppers seemed greasy after being flash-fried (frying being the cooking technique of choice at the restaurant). These dishes were followed by the Lamb breast, wonderfully accented by cumin and lime, but so incredibly fatty (to be fair, we were warned that it would be so) that it seemed unhealthy to partake beyond a few bites; and A Chicken and Woffals, a twist on the fried chicken and waffles popular across the city at brunch time, but featuring jerk chicken. I think a tad more foie gras (and waffles!) would have made it sublime, but it was still intriguing.... On my subsequent visits, I've enjoyed the Cauli balls: tempura cauliflower with romesco sauce; and the Bassa Nova (seabass with mushrooms and hush puppies). But, there have also been a large number of misses that prompt me to question their consistency and execution. A laundry list of my complaints would include the Nippon Nachos: fried gyoza nachos topped with cheddar, gouda, and Jalapeno accented sour cream, accompanied by a tart pico de gallo; a kale salad with an uninspiring dressing that didn't compensate for the difficulty of chowing down an un-chopped salad; Fawn-tons with venison; and Tacos with Reuben covered by cheese that was as tasteful as one imagines an industrial by-product would... The bar does a competent job with the seasonally changing drinks. One I liked particularly was the Fitzgerald. But, there are no pretensions as to dessert. There is none - other than a snickers ice cream bar (sourced from the corner bodega), served in its original wrapper. I don't know the food critics who find this charming, but they should check in their badges at the door. I appreciate that the kitchen makes no pretensions, but that doesn't mean that they can't try. As one who believes that no meal is complete without dessert, the lack of thoughtfulness when it comes to desserts ends an otherwise entertaining meal very abruptly, and would make me reconsider any subsequent visit. Still, I'm rounding up from 3.5 stars due to the background music, and my sentimentality for the Pet Shop Boys."

My girlfriend had a dish that was 16 dollars and literally consisted of about 6 thin slices of speck and about 6 or seven roman (tiny) artichoke hearts.  It was average at best. My 20 dollar burger was good, though the Roquefort was a little bit overpowering.  And though the shoestring fries were good, they did not make up for the price of the slightly above average burger.  My two other friends ordered Cuban sandwiches which they said were good, but a little dry.   Service was ok, though a bit Inattentive at times.  The atmosphere is very laid back, which was nice.  In the end though, the food disappointed and was overpriced.  I hate to say it, but this place defines overrated."

The simple salad mix of quinoa & spring greens was refreshing. That slice of bread was soft & chewy with a nice crunchy crust. And that smoked tuna cake?

We shared the forager and the fennel sausage pizza. I usually prefer white pizza, and was really excited that it came with mushrooms, which is my favorite combination. So I was surprised that I actually enjoyed the fennel sausage one a lot more, and was pretty disappointed with the forager pizza. We also had the french toast, which was very good, the grilled skirt steak hash, which I would describe as ""not bad,"" the bacon, and the rosemary potatoes, both of which were just ok.

Out of all of the fab restaurants in NYC, how did I decide on this particular one?  All I did was type in ""Eggs Benedict"" into Yelp and Balthazar quickly came up as the #1 match. Apparently, their Eggs Benedict was a big deal.  Perfect for me -- since I constantly strive to be an Eggs Benedict connoisseur by tasting different kinds at different restaurants at every brunch occasion. Out of all that I've tried (at various places primarily in the Bay Area, Southern California, Vegas, and NYC area), Balthazar is hands down my favorite (as of today, 7/5/10). The eggs are perfectly poached -- with the yolk not too overcooked yet not too runny.  On top, the eggs are drizzled with a perfect amount of delicate, savory, and buttery hollandaise sauce.  All of which sits on top of a small portion of potatoes with caramelized onions.  One word describes this dish: HEAVENLY. You definitely get what you pay for -- which, in this case, is $20.  However, I suggest you open your pockets a bit (at your own discretion) if you want to indulge in a memorable brunch experience at Balthazar."

The crust is soft and chewy without being too dense. It might be easier eating with a fork and knife - if you have a lot of toppings, each slice might be droopy - and let's face it, this isn't your neighborhood pizzeria pizza where your slice can hold its own by lifting it by the crust. If you like basil, you'll find your happy place, because each pizza comes with bunches of it, as well as fresh garlic (which you can probably omit, if you request it). The variety of pizza toppings is limited. One meat - pepperoni - and a bunch of vegetable options - shallots, mushrooms, peppers, there might be more, I forget. Get the shallots, they are delicious. The calzone comes in two sizes and you can add whatever toppings you want (limited to the ones you can put on your pizza of course). Cheese fiends will rejoice because the ricotta is seriously fresh and creamy. Needless to say, after two whole pizzas between four people, a large calzone took some effort in finishing, but that cheese was uh-mazing."

Again, if I were to come back again (doubtful) unless by some celestial phenomenon a future marathon and daylight savings coincide and it is too early for miriam or buttermilk channel to be open, only then, I will order just the pancakes."

If you are big fan of all things fried, this place would be a 3. But if you love katsu (Japanese style breaded and fried meat/seafood), this place is a definite 4. Food: 5 Decor:3 Service:4 Price:3 As you can guess from the name, they serve all sorts of Katsu, chicken, port, seafood etc. They are breaded just the right amount and taste like they have been fried fresh. Not that greasy and certainly very crisp. Most of the set menu comes with rice, miso soup and huge pile of shredded cabbage (almost unlimited servings...I have on different occasions ask for refills two times). They do Katsu really well, but just Katsu. So if you are not a Katsu fan, this place would be overall 3 star restaurant rather than a 4. Decor is very basic and service is alright . Set menus are in the $15-18 range, which is ok for the quality of the food."

If you are traveling to NY from Europe you might not consider a pizza in Brooklyn, and that would be a mistake. The pizza here is up there among the very best. The thin crust is delightfully light and the fresh toppings come through the tomato and cheese base with great aroma and texture. The restaurant is not big and you'll generally find a queue of people waiting. Inside your choice is simple, pizza (pie) or calzone, with a pick from 6-7 toppings. We managed two pizza between the four of us and the two boys could maybe have had a slice extra, but that would have been out of greediness.   I've tried a few acclaimed pizzeria in Italy and around Europe, but would be challenged to say this one does not rank up there with the best. Over 6000km from the pizza motherland, Lucali does the homeland proud. Note: they do not serve any alcohol, so head down the street and buy a bottle before visiting. They will provide glasses :)"

I recently ordered a half chicken from your brunch menu and was dismayed to see that the chicken appeared to have neither breasts nor wings. Can your chickens fly? (But actually, can any chickens fly?) Are they more than medium-sized chicken legs, exactly one of which appeared on my plate? I assume from the half-chicken advertised that your chickens have (at least) two legs, to my relief. I am also concerned about an identity crisis among your waffle(s). I ordered ""woffels"" (note the plural, with the chicken $14) but received exactly one wedge of one waffle. It was delicious and had this great buttery topping, but it made me wonder: does your waffle feel like it has two selves? Is that why you advertise it as a plural on the menu? I know that in our day and age as busy New Yorkers, we are pulled in so many directions and sometimes struggle to eke out a coherent existence, and just want your waffle wedge to know that it was a really good, if singular, offering. I also received several leaves of spinach. They were delicious, please and thank you. I sincerely hope your chickens are doing OK. Perhaps your great, attentive serving staff could turn some of its attention to them just to check in."

Service is good, BYOB is a major money saver, and it's a real wood-fired oven, so in the winter the place is exceptionally warm and cozy. I also appreciate how simple and exposed their kitchen is. It's just about the pizza, so they only have a single marble counter where two guys make the pies, and then the oven of course, where another guy mans the fire and cooks the pizza. Without one of these wood-fired ovens that gets up to 900 degrees, it's difficult to make exceptional pizza. In about 8 minutes or less, the pie comes out with that perfect crust and all the rest.

This is my 2012 Winter Date Spot Suggestion First and foremost I would like to thank my fellow Yelpers for scouting out this place. I came across your reviews and was inspired to stop by. This is not exactly in a location where I would expect to find a restaurant like this. Loved the cuisine, the rustic woods, the beautiful modern touches that were lit by candles, and dim lights around the room. The Holiday season can be painful on the pocketbook; it's nice to find a restaurant with good quality food, fair portions, and a reasonable menu. Appetizers range from $3.50-13, and mains range from $11-22, and all desserts are listed at $8. For starter we shared the tuna tartare which the kitchen politely split. I had the kale salad, which was delicious!! My dining companion had the potato leek soup and the steak salad which both looked fantastic. Our waitress suggested the pan-seared striped sea bass served with green and yellow squash and garbanzo beans, which I greatly enjoyed. Dessert was delicious as well - the lemon sorbet with Argentine liquor poured over the top. Each portion of the menu our waitress paired with something off of their wine list. I couldn't have been happier with her selections. Date Rating: 10 Pick up Scale: 3 Strong Suggestion: Come hungry, and bring someone you enjoy talking to."
